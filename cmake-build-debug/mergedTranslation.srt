Hey, Andy! Where you been?
It's an all-hands function.

71
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,573
Come here.
I want you to meet Joanie.
Joanie, this is Andy Tyler.

73
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,492
Hello. Hi.
He's my best friend.

74
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:53,577
We went to Annapolis together.
Nice to meet you, Joanie.

76
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,287
Hey, I got you
one of Larson's stogies.

78
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:58,123
To our Navy's
next sub skipper.
Thank you.

79
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:59,194
Here, a Larson cigar. 
For our future Pasha

80
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:02,836
Lieutenant.
You gonna hoist up a few beers
with the enlisted boys later?

82
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:05,130
You got it, Griggs.
All right.

84
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,928
Mr. Tyler. Mr. Tyler.

85
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,555
My mom is here visiting.
Can I bring her over
to meet you?

86
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,140
Sure thing, Trigger.
Sure thing.

88
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:16,892
That's the lieutenant
I was talking about.

90
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,442
Lieutenant Tyler!

91
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:29,613
Hello there, Prudence,
Louise. Mrs. Dahlgren,
Captain.

93
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:33,075
Where's your date, Andy?
It's not like you
to arrive stag like this.

95
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,412
I'm afraid I couldn't get one
on such short notice, ma'am.

97
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,372
Captain, could I have
a word with you?

99
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:41,583
Certainly. Darling,
will you excuse us?
Okay.

101
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:42,793
Be right back.

103
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:59,476
I didn't get my boat.
I know.

106
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:03,564
And with all due respect, sir,
there's only one way
that could have happened.

108
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,692
And that's if you withheld
your recommendation.

110
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:10,779
That's right.
I just don't think
you're ready.

113
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:13,991
What do you mean,
I'm not ready?

115
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:17,119
Sir, I have worked my tail off
on the S-33.

117
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,246
I'm qualified in every area
and then some.

118
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,248
No executive officer
has higher marks than I do,
Captain.

119
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,458
Andy!

120
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:23,320
I am the highest rated 
of all the Officers in Second

121
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:27,546
You're just not ready
to take on a command
of your own.

123
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,761
Now I've made my decision.
It's done.

125
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:41,351
Mr. Tyler.
How you doing, sir?

127
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:46,315
Having a good time?
Hell, yeah, Chief.

130
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:50,611
How about you?
Looking forward
to getting underway.

132
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:53,197
I'm a sea dog.
Need some salt, sir.

133
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:54,643
I can't wait to get on board. 
I miss the sea air

134
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:59,119
He torpedoed me, Chief.

136
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,623
Nine months aboard the S-33. . .

138
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,709
doing the best job I know how.

140
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:08,879
Doing everything once
and then doing it again.

142
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:12,466
Just to make sure
I didn't miss anything
the first time.

144
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:17,012
You'll get your chance, sir.
There's other commands
in the Navy.

146
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:22,684
You knew?

147
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:24,881
Did you know ?

148
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:27,397
Didn't warn me.

149
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:28,802
You didn't tell me anything

150
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:32,653
Ain't my place, sir.

152
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,073
CIub secured!
Time to go!

154
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,411
et's go. Get out.
Everyone out.

155
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,747
This club's secured.
Gotta go.

156
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,959
What's the meaning
of this, Sergeant?

158
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:50,212
You the senior man?
That's right.
I'm the XO of the S-33.

160
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:54,258
These men have
a 48-hour liberty pass.
No, sir, not no more.

163
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:28,278
Team 3

164
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:30,530
To the report before the relief

165
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:32,824
Team 3, 
to the report of the Principal Master

166
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:42,723
What the hell are those
yard birds doing to my boat?

168
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:45,809
Looks like a goddamn
Nazi submarine.

170
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:49,479
Hey, Andy.
This is a fine Navy day.

171
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:50,925
Another coup from the Navy

172
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:53,553
Detachment C, to security

173
00:13:53,985 --> 00:13:57,863
They wouldn't give me
five minutes to consummate
my marriage. Five minutes!

175
00:13:57,989 --> 00:14:01,241
What's going on here?
Hell if I know.
Put your cover on.

177
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,618
Yes, sir.

179
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:06,163
Mr. Tyler, call the crew
to quarters.
Aye, Captain.

181
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:10,584
Quarters! Everybody fall in !
Let's get in formation now!

183
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:14,171
Let's go! Now! Formation !

185
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:18,592
Repair Crew 3,
muster with First Lieutenant.

186
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:21,428
Repair Crew 3,
muster with First Lieutenant.

187
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:24,473
Captain Dahlgren,
all crew members present
and accounted for, sir!

189
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:26,642
Very well. At ease.

191
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:28,046
Repos !

192
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:32,773
I'm sorry your liberty's
been cut short,
but our schedule's changed.

194
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:37,527
We have two hours
to get stowed for sea
and set the maneuvering watch.

196
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,988
Mr. Larson,
have your torpedomen. . .

197
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:41,782
load the tubes
with their four best fish.

199
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:45,577
Mr. Emmett,
warm up the diesels
and line up a battery charge.

201
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:50,165
Mr. Tyler, we have dry stores,
ordnance and perishables
to get below decks.

203
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:53,335
Gentlemen, it's our turn.

205
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:56,171
That's all.

206
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,923
Attention !

209
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:01,718
Aye, Captain.

210
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:07,265
Crew dismissed.
You heard the man.
Stores load.

213
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:11,395
You got six seconds
to get on your boondockers
and dungarees and turn to.

215
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,397
Mr. Tyler, is this for real,
or is it a drill?

216
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,399
I mean, you know,
"it's our turn,"
what does that mean?

218
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,609
I thought we had
a two-day liberty pass.
What's going on?

220
00:15:17,694 --> 00:15:21,238
I don't know. I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

223
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:23,573
Get your jobs done now.

225
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:26,368
AII off-going
duty officers,
report to the dock....

226
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:29,913
Captain Dahlgren,
could you fill me in
on what's going on, sir?

227
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:32,457
I mean,
we're obviously not going
to the Caribbean station.

229
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,168
No, we're not.
We're going on a special op.

231
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:39,006
You'll be briefed
with Mr. Emmett and Mr. Larson
once we get underway.

233
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,675
Aye, sir.
Andy, listen to me.

235
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:44,177
I'm gonna need the very best
from you on this run. . .

237
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:47,180
regardless of any differences
you may have with me.

239
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,099
Are we clear on that?

241
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,727
Yes, sir.
Good.

242
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,982
Now go find Radioman Wentz
and quietly escort him
to the materiel office.

245
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:08,243
Mr. Tyler. How are you, son?
I'm fine, Admiral Duke.

248
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:13,206
What brings you up here?
He does.
That's Lieutenant Hirsch.

250
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,167
He's gonna be
riding your boat.

252
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:19,796
You're not working for SUBLANT
on this run. Mr. Hirsch
has operational control.

254
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:23,133
He's the boss.
Anything he wants, he gets.

256
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,415
This is the Minister's point of view

257
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,056
All right.

258
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,959
Good

259
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:32,684
Is this him?

260
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,005
It's him ?

261
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:40,136
I was told

262
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:43,765
that your family 
is from Koblenz

263
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:47,977
A real family 
of Rhenish peasants

264
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:53,107
Do you understand me, Herr Wentz?

265
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:54,456
Yes, sir.

266
00:16:55,943 --> 00:17:00,198
Do you speak German fluently? 
Can you read and write it?

267
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,076
Or are you an illiterate redneck

268
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:05,328
in the German name?

269
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,667
I am a redneck

270
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,921
but I can read and write 
and I speak well

271
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:17,256
I studied German

272
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:22,970
at university before committing 
to the fight against fascism

273
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:34,704
He'll do.
Thank you, Wentz.
That's all for now.

277
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:36,748
Lieutenant,
prepare the boat
to get underway.

279
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,251
Aye, sir. Admiral.

280
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,887
Mr. Tyler, please,
don't tell the other guys
I'm half German.

283
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,890
They'll hate me.

284
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,169
On me haïrait

285
00:17:55,518 --> 00:17:57,477
Yeah, sure thing, Wentz.

287
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,151
Repair Crew 3,
muster with First Lieutenant.

288
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:07,320
Repair Crew 3,
muster with First Lieutenant.

289
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:18,248
Will the Duty Officer
break to the paint shop.

290
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,750
Duty Officer
to the paint shop.

291
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:25,005
You all right, Mr. Tyler?

293
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:31,136
Tiptop, Eddie. Tiptop.

295
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:37,559
Wanna thank you
for that liberty pass.

297
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:42,564
My girl thanks you, too.

299
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,193
You're a good man,
Mr. Tyler.

301
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:49,321
Heart's in the right place.

303
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,115
Just need to give it
some time.

305
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,039
Yeah, I heard about
what happened to you.

307
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,920
That's one of the advantages
of being seen
and not being seen.

309
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:10,008
You'd be surprised
some of the shit
we mess stewards hear.

311
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:14,054
Boy, don't go dropping
my eggs. Now look.

313
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:15,805
Damn. Excuse me, Mr. Tyler.

314
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,227
Look, all you got to do is
pick them up with both hands,
boy, both hands!

316
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,022
Tyler!

317
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,734
When the hell were you
gonna tell me? I hear
about this from the chief?

319
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:30,820
What do you want me to say?
He shit-canned me.

321
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:33,073
Now you're gonna transfer
to another boat.

323
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:35,200
Excuse me.
Either one of you two. . .

324
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:36,993
tell me where I can find
the exec of this thing?

326
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:40,080
Yeah, that's me, mac.
We'll have your truck
unloaded here shortly.

328
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:41,373
Well, you'll unload it now.

329
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:44,084
Here's the manifest.
Let's get those crates
below decks.

331
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:45,293
Who the hell are you?

333
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,671
Marine Major Coonan,
Office of Naval Intelligence.

335
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,422
I'm going to sea
with you boys.

337
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:53,677
That's my luggage.
You got a problem,
talk to Mr. Hirsch.

339
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:12,946
Clear!

340
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,031
- Cast off all lines forward!
- Cast off forward !

342
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,700
Take in all lines aft.

343
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:18,243
Cast off aft!

345
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,955
Rudder amidships.

346
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,124
All ahead one-third.

348
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,251
All ahead one-third!

349
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,764
Bridge hatch shut.

350
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:22,390
Engine room,
secure the diesels.

352
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:24,100
Switch the ship propulsion
to the battery.

354
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:26,728
Engine room,
secure diesels, switch
propulsion to the battery.

355
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,855
- Main induction indicates shut.
- Aye.

357
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,398
Green board, Skipper.
Very well.

359
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:33,318
Passing the 100-fathom curve.
On course, on time, sir.

361
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:36,363
Engine room reports
secured diesels, propulsion
switched to battery.

363
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:40,116
Very well.
All ahead two-thirds.
All ahead two-thirds, aye.

365
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:41,785
Mr. Emmett, take her down.

366
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:44,746
Make her depth 150 feet,
10 degree down bubble.

368
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,374
150 feet, 10 degree
down bubble. Aye, sir.

369
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,835
Chief of the watch,
sound the dive alarm.
Pass the word along the 1 MC.

371
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,214
Open the main
ballast tank vents.
Aye, sir, passing the word.

373
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:56,007
AII ahead
two thirds, sir.

374
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:57,884
Dive, dive, dive.

376
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:01,971
Sir, main ballast
tank vents indicate open.

378
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,807
Aye. Both planes dive,
15 degrees.

380
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:06,434
Both planes dive,
15 degrees. Aye.

381
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:09,562
All clear!

382
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:13,650
Decks awash.
Decks awash.
Aye, sir.

384
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,348
First time on a submarine?
That's right.

386
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:47,044
Absolutely

387
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:49,853
60 feet.

388
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,632
60 feet

389
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,358
Lower the scope.

391
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:01,698
Captain, engine room
reports minor flooding from
shaft seals and brine pump.

393
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:05,034
Bilge is at 18 inches
and rising.
Very well.

395
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,746
How deep
does this thing go?

397
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,791
She'll go
all the way to the bottom
if we don't stop her.

399
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:14,627
Normally we try
not to get below 150 feet.

400
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:17,088
Any deeper,
the leaks overwhelm the pumps.

402
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:21,009
These S-boats are antiques,
older than most of the crew.

404
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:26,890
100 feet.
Aye.

406
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:34,272
Excuse me, Mr. Emmett.

407
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,902
Put a pipe patch on it,
lash it with marline.

409
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:40,528
The yard can fix it
when we get back to port.

411
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:42,280
Aye, sir.

412
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:48,203
Relax, gentlemen.
She's old, but she'll hold.

414
00:23:51,248 --> 00:23:53,291
Last night,
at 0300 hours...

416
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,253
a British destroyer
reported depth-charging
and sinking a German U-boat.

418
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,756
However, some time
thereafter. . .

420
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,135
Allied direction-finding
stations triangulated a coded
enemy radio signal. . .

422
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,430
to this position here,
near the CHOP line.

424
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,558
We believe the U-boat
was disabled, not sunk. . .

426
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:13,478
and is drifting eastward
on a four-knot current.

428
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:16,648
Now, French resistance
reported a resupply
submarine. . .

430
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:20,026
sailed from
the Lorient U-boat pens
yesterday afternoon. . .

431
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,903
with engine parts
and mechanics.

433
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:25,865
And we believe
it's gonna rendezvous
with the disabled U-boat.

436
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:29,285
Onboard that U-boat is this.

438
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:37,460
A typewriter?
An Enigma code machine.

440
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:41,297
It allows the German navy
to communicate with
its submarines in secret.

442
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:45,552
And our inability
to decipher their messages
is costing us this war.

444
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:47,387
Mr. Coonan.

445
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:50,473
All right, this is basically
a Trojan Horse operation.

447
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,353
The S-33 will rendezvous
with the U-boat, posing
as the German resupply sub.

449
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:56,646
I will lead
a boarding party. . .

450
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,357
dressed in
Kriegsmarine uniforms
to the enemy submarine.

452
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:02,485
We will take it by force
and secure the Enigma.

454
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,071
Any German survivors
will be transferred
to the S-33. . .

455
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,447
and the U-boat
will be scuttled.

457
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:09,075
The German resupply
submarine will arrive
at the rendezvous. . .

459
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,537
and will assume that
the U-boat succumbed
to its wounds and sank.

461
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:16,249
The Germans must never
suspect we have the Enigma.
That is vital.

463
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:19,252
- So it's a race?
- Yes, effectively.

466
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,922
Who's the boarding party?
Well, since you're the XO,
you, sir.

468
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:26,134
Mr. Emmett, Mr. Larson,
Mr. Hirsch and nine
of your ship's company.

471
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:29,262
The captain, of course,
will remain onboard the S-33.

473
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:34,225
Mr. Coonan, our boys
are submarine sailors,
not combat Marines.

475
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,186
The boys onboard that U-boat
are sailors too.

477
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:40,857
Your men will be ready,
Lieutenant.
I'll train them myself.

478
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:44,068
You've come to the right boat.

480
00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:27,973
Okay, we try

481
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:46,992
Do you call yourself a mechanic?

482
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,455
I was an apprentice with my uncle, 
I repaired motorcycles

483
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,415
I do what I can

484
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,292
Here we are!

485
00:26:57,711 --> 00:26:59,296
Commander, on the bridge!

486
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:01,047
I need a Mechanic

487
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,365
Ahoy! Friends!
Guten Tag.

488
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:15,743
We have many wounded !

490
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:17,453
Take us prisoner, please!

491
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:18,815
Take us prisoner

492
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,498
We'll be no trouble.

494
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:23,251
Give us a hand !

496
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:27,213
It's the law of the sea,
my friend.

497
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:30,744
Impossible. Open fire

498
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:32,537
What?

499
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:37,918
No castaways on board. 
Order of FÜHRER

500
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,267
We need water and food !

501
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,963
And if we leave them

502
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:47,066
We just want to get home!

503
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,219
they risk 
giving our position

504
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:50,222
Execution!

505
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:56,617
We just need
a bit of a hand.

506
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:58,995
We have no--

507
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:28,691
I'm telling you, she
was hotter than Dorothy Lamour
and better built.

509
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:31,986
Really?
Yeah, I could tell
she was interested.

511
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,530
But she was classy,
you know?

513
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:38,534
The type of girl that wants
you to take her to a country
club dance or something.

515
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,412
Yeah, like you've ever seen
the inside of a country club.

517
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:44,123
Hey! Like I'd even want to,
all right?

519
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:48,586
Anyway, I can see
I'm not getting
anywhere with her. . .

522
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,256
so what I do is,
I use my secret weapon.

524
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:55,760
I tell her about the S-26.
Does the trick right away.

526
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:58,805
Man, you don't want
to be talking about that
while we're underway.

528
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:01,808
Why? What happened
with the S-26?
Yeah, what happened?

530
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:03,518
You guys don't know?

531
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:04,936
No.
No.

533
00:29:07,064 --> 00:29:09,982
She was running a test dive
down off Norfolk.

535
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:12,777
Shaft seal failed.

537
00:29:13,695 --> 00:29:15,905
She sunk to 400 feet.

539
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:20,243
Know how much water pressure
there is that deep?

541
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,219
Mazzola, you will be
the first one eating
powdered eggs on this cruise.

543
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:40,096
Keep it up, you hear?

544
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:40,999
I reserve the powdered eggs for you

545
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:48,938
Come in.

546
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:50,216
Come in

547
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,406
This is our position, Captain.
We're still bucking
some pretty heavy seas.

549
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,868
I estimate us to be
about three hours
behind schedule.

551
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:04,537
I told Mr. Emmett
to run at flank speed
and hold off on a trim dive. . .

552
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:06,330
until we make up
the lost time.

554
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,374
That's fine, Lieutenant.

556
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,795
You're a first-rate XO,
Andy.

558
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:15,464
A damn good submariner.

560
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,261
I know the men like you.

562
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:23,222
I'd give my life
for any one of them, sir.

564
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:26,559
I know you would.
I'm not questioning
your bravery.

566
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:30,354
The question is
what about their lives?

568
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:35,151
You and Mr. Emmett
are good friends.

570
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,778
Went through
the Academy together.

572
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:41,490
Would you be willing
to sacrifice his life?

574
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,785
Or what about
some of the younger
enlisted men?

576
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,247
I know a lot of those guys
look up to you
like a big brother.

578
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:51,208
You willing to lay
their lives on the line?

580
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:55,463
You see? You hesitate.

582
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:59,008
But as a captain, you can't.

584
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,594
You have to act.

586
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,222
If you don't, you put
the entire crew at risk.

588
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:09,310
Now that's the job.
It's not a science.

590
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:11,812
You have to be able
to make hard decisions. . .

591
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:14,523
based on
imperfect information.

593
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:18,611
Asking men to carry out
orders that may result
in their deaths.

595
00:31:18,695 --> 00:31:22,782
And if you're wrong,
you suffer the consequences.

597
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:27,495
If you're not prepared
to make those decisions. . .

599
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:31,540
without pause,
without reflection. . .

601
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:36,545
then you've got no business
being a submarine captain.

603
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:45,388
Tell Mr. Hirsch
I'd like a word with him,
would you?

605
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:49,684
Aye, sir.

606
00:32:53,832 --> 00:32:56,125
- More soup, Captain?
- Thank you.

608
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:00,504
Wishing I was going
with you, gentlemen.

610
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,174
I feel the same way
you do, Carson.

612
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:06,302
Gentlemen, I'd like
to propose a toast.

614
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:08,846
To the officers and crew
of the S-33. . .

616
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,475
and our distinguished guests,
Mr. Hirsch and Mr. Coonan.

618
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:14,602
Success, gentlemen !

619
00:33:14,686 --> 00:33:16,604
Success.
Success.

621
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:21,734
Captain Dahlgren, sir?
What is it, Wentz?

623
00:33:21,818 --> 00:33:25,279
Chief says we've picked up
a radar contact at 070.

625
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:28,741
Very well. Mr. Larson?

626
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:47,551
Signal lamp
off the starboard bow!

628
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:52,348
I see it.

629
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:53,751
I see him

630
00:33:54,976 --> 00:33:58,604
Pass the word along.
Submarine sighted
off the starboard bow.

632
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:01,148
Stand by to man
battle stations.
Aye, sir.

633
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:01,425
Submarine in sight. 
At battle stations

634
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:05,903
All right, here we go.
One last time.

636
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:08,864
Lieutenant Tyler's raft gets
from the conning tower aft.

638
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,741
My raft gets the gun crew.

640
00:34:10,826 --> 00:34:13,410
And no one, no one shoots
till I shoot first.

642
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:15,704
- You read me?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,374
Outstanding. Lock and load.

646
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,803
It'll be all right, son.
Yes, sir.

648
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:39,145
Captain, I estimate
the German resupply sub has
a 14-knot speed of advance.

650
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:40,980
My latest plot puts them
at 12 hours away, sir.

651
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,439
Very well, Mr. Larson.

653
00:34:42,524 --> 00:34:46,360
Captain, the boarding party's
ready, sir.
Await your go-ahead.

654
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:47,778
I put her low
in the water.

656
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:51,407
I wanna give that U-boat
as little silhouette
as we can.

658
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,077
Sir?
Prepare to disembark
the boarding party.

659
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,620
Aye, Captain.

660
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:56,897
Prepare to land the commando

661
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,168
If this thing
goes south. . .

662
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:04,795
I will blow that Nazi boat
right out of the water.

664
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,423
Understood, sir.
Very well.

666
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:09,452
Perfect

667
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:38,913
All set, Captain.

669
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:40,789
Now you listen to me.

671
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,667
You get them their damn trophy
and you get the hell
out of there.

673
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:47,546
Aye, sir.
The boys are gonna be fine.

675
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:50,966
I know they will, sir.

677
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:56,013
Good luck, Andy.

679
00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:59,350
Godspeed, Skipper.

681
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:31,617
Our comrades bring eggs

682
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:36,205
bananas 
and even our mail!

683
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:38,032
Easy, Mr. Hirsch.
We're almost there.

686
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,993
We're gonna bushwhack them
real good.

688
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:50,419
All right,
we got 12 men topside,
three on the bridge. . .

690
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,172
four on the foredeck,
five aft.

692
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:58,052
Now remember, both rafts
need to be tied up
before we move.

694
00:37:58,454 --> 00:37:59,747
before acting

695
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:05,225
Jesus H. Christ.
They got machine guns.

697
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,102
Steady, gentlemen.

699
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:09,396
Wait for the signal.

700
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:11,300
Wait for the signal

701
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:38,842
Mr. Hirsch.

704
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:43,639
Hello the boat, you asshole.
Shut up.

706
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,276
Goddamn you, Hirsch,
say something.

708
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:02,351
Who are the mechanics?

709
00:39:13,112 --> 00:39:15,531
We are all mechanical aces

710
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:19,993
It will be fixed at dawn

711
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:25,165
Who wants this filth?

712
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:29,211
A bunch of dirty letters 
and porn pictures?

713
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:33,006
It stinks of French perfume!

714
00:39:33,715 --> 00:39:36,301
A real bag of shit!

715
00:39:36,552 --> 00:39:38,303
I'm crazy about it!

716
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,744
welcome aboard

717
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:05,122
Are you from Wiesbaden?

718
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:23,822
Let's board this thing.
Let's board it.
Board it! Get out of the raft.

720
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,768
Push them back

721
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:28,911
Conning tower. Move. Move.

724
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:34,708
Clear the conning tower now!

726
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:41,173
Watch yourself,
there. Man in the hole.
Another one there!

728
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,926
- Griggs is hit!
- Get him off!

730
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:53,101
Move, move!
Trigger, round the back. Now!

732
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:57,606
Griggs! Griggs!

733
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,983
We gotta get inside!
Griggs!

735
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:02,694
Chief, Tank,
come down now!

737
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,405
Ready?

738
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,785
All right, open it! Fire!

740
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:14,998
Tyler, let's go!
Inside!

743
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,794
Cover your men ! Go, go!

745
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:26,969
Don't let them
close it.
Don't let them close it!

747
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:36,588
Open the ballasts

748
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:39,966
Let's drown this vermin! 
Get your ass off!

749
00:41:43,845 --> 00:41:45,972
Faster ! Diving!

750
00:41:48,658 --> 00:41:51,159
Two, three, four,
five. Shut it.

752
00:41:52,495 --> 00:41:54,580
Let's go. Go! Get down ! Go!

754
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:57,207
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

755
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,720
Get off, get off!
Don't move, don't move!

757
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:12,139
Get back, get back,
get back!

759
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:14,182
Just drop it! Drop it!

761
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:17,587
Fire!

762
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:25,944
Get them outta here!
Get them outta here!

764
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:28,363
You hit?
Yeah, I'm okay.

766
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,245
Stern team, go! Bow team, go!

768
00:42:41,544 --> 00:42:43,670
I'm outta clips, sir.
You go ahead.

770
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:46,840
Rabbit!

771
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:49,176
All right, get them
outta here. Get them
outta here. Let's go!

773
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,179
Get down. Down, down,
down, down ! Get down !

775
00:42:52,263 --> 00:42:55,057
All right, who's the captain?
Huh? Who's the captain?

777
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:57,976
Kapitän?
How about you, ugly?
Are you the captain?

779
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:00,437
Trigger, if anybody moves. . .

780
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:02,606
you shoot them right here
in the forehead,
you understand me?

781
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,066
Yes, sir!
All right.

782
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,593
At the first gesture, shoot! Including ?

783
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:24,961
Hirsch, we got it.

784
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,281
On l'a

785
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,069
Speaking in German]
Get down, down !

786
00:44:31,154 --> 00:44:33,238
Down there!

789
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,615
Down, down !

790
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,578
Rabbit, check the bilge
for a scuttling charge.
Give me your weapon !

792
00:44:39,662 --> 00:44:41,747
- Move, sailor, move!
- Aye, sir!

794
00:44:44,834 --> 00:44:46,752
Goddamn it, stay there.

796
00:44:49,672 --> 00:44:51,757
Hirsch, I think we got
the code books!

797
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:53,592
Andy, that ink's running.
Dry it.

799
00:44:53,676 --> 00:44:54,760
Okay.

801
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:59,014
It's water soluble.
Yeah, use the blankets,
use the blankets.

803
00:44:59,374 --> 00:45:01,084
With blankets

804
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:04,394
Nothing but pipes and valves,
Mr. Emmett.

806
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,188
Bow compartment secure.

808
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:31,713
Bunch of Marys.

809
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:33,825
Bunch of wimps

810
00:45:35,593 --> 00:45:38,720
How you doing?
You're number 10.
There you go.

813
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,308
You having a good night?
Uh-huh.

815
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:45,977
You ain't gonna be
none too happy
y'all lost this boat.

817
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:48,230
Lucky number 11, let's go!

819
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:52,651
It's your first time
looking at a black man,
ain't it?

821
00:45:52,735 --> 00:45:54,277
Get used to it.

823
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:57,072
Let's go! Get over here!

825
00:46:31,482 --> 00:46:32,774
All right,
hurry it up.

826
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:35,110
It's gonna be sunup
in an hour.

828
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:15,817
Fuse is burning, sir.

829
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:19,029
All right,
she's burning ! Let's go!
Let's get this raft loaded !

832
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:20,572
Let's move!

833
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:21,808
Let's hurry!

834
00:47:21,866 --> 00:47:24,910
Sir, we got
all the prisoners transferred
to the S-33.

835
00:47:24,994 --> 00:47:26,328
Very well.

836
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:27,480
The prisoners 
are on board the S-33

837
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,587
Hey, Andy.

838
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,506
Make sure
you got everything !
Get in the raft!

840
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:41,176
Get everything
below decks. Let's go!

842
00:48:23,302 --> 00:48:26,012
Everybody, below decks!
Get down !

844
00:48:26,097 --> 00:48:27,973
Chief, take her down !
Aye, sir!

846
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,725
The scuttling charge!
Let's go, Hirsch !
The Enigma!

849
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:38,900
Trigger! Grab hold !

850
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,470
Catch!

851
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,323
Trigger! Attaboy!

852
00:48:51,122 --> 00:48:52,539
I've got it!

853
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:55,834
Help me! Help me! Oh, no! No!

855
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:05,510
We gotta get
outta here!

857
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:07,387
There's still men
in the water.

858
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:09,973
Let's go!
Chief, there's still men
in the water.

860
00:49:10,057 --> 00:49:11,516
Go!

861
00:49:17,982 --> 00:49:19,399
Andy!

863
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:22,610
Andy! Go!

864
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:24,472
Go for it !

865
00:49:25,114 --> 00:49:26,322
Dive!

866
00:49:26,724 --> 00:49:27,558
In diving!

867
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:29,075
Dive!

868
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:31,953
Take her down !

870
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:34,914
Tyler.

871
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,000
Dive!

872
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:42,107
Chief, you find those vents?
Everything's in German !

874
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:43,983
Rabbit,
get to the torpedo room.
Sir.

876
00:50:44,068 --> 00:50:47,821
Where's the goddamn 1 MC?
Trigger, get on the helm !
Mazzola, take the planes.

879
00:50:47,947 --> 00:50:49,948
Aye, sir.
Wentz,
what about these?

880
00:50:50,032 --> 00:50:52,283
I don't know. I don't know.
There's no label !

882
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:55,328
Okay, those are
the aft ballast tank vents!

884
00:50:55,412 --> 00:50:58,581
These are the mid-ship vents
and these are
the main induction valves.

886
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:01,626
Make sure they're shut.
Tank, Tank, I need speed !

888
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,961
Get the screws turning.

889
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:04,087
The lights are on. . .

890
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:06,131
so there's got to be
some power left
in those ballasts.

892
00:51:06,215 --> 00:51:07,340
I can't read this!

893
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:09,425
Rabbit,
find out how many fish
we've got in the tubes. . .

895
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,678
and figure out
how to launch them ! Go!

897
00:51:11,846 --> 00:51:13,388
I can't read this!

898
00:51:13,556 --> 00:51:18,143
Go help Tank, Hirsch.
Go, Hirsch !
Find the Christmas tree.

900
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:21,396
We've gotta make sure
we don't have any holes
in the boat!

903
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,648
Klar, klar, klar. Wentz,
what the hell is kIar?

905
00:51:24,525 --> 00:51:27,068
KIar means clear.
KIar means clear.
All compartments secure.

907
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:28,987
White for green?
White for green.

909
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:31,072
- No holes in the ship!
- Dive the boat!

911
00:51:31,574 --> 00:51:34,576
Opening ballast vents!
Opening mid-ship valves!

913
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:36,911
Opening mid-ship vents!

914
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:38,689
Opening of ballasts

915
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:50,633
This is forward trim,
aft trim.
These are auxiliaries.

917
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:53,428
Main motor.
Auxiliary, auxiliary.

919
00:52:08,652 --> 00:52:11,029
This is in meters.
Everything's in meters.

921
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:12,822
Passing 15 meters.

923
00:52:12,907 --> 00:52:14,782
Recommend shutting main vents!

925
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:17,744
Make it so! Wentz,
get in the sound room.
See what's out there.

927
00:52:17,828 --> 00:52:18,995
Yes, sir!

929
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:21,039
Make depth 20 meters.
Depth 20 meters, aye.

931
00:52:21,123 --> 00:52:24,584
Chief, take the dive!
I have the dive.

933
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:29,214
At 20 meters. Bow planes
at zero. Control your depth
with the stern planes.

937
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:32,133
Bow planes at zero.
Controlling depth
with the stern planes.

938
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:34,969
Oh, shit.
All ahead full, sir!

940
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:37,180
Batteries are flat
and draining fast!

942
00:52:37,264 --> 00:52:40,934
Mr. Tyler, I hear
the S-33 breaking up. Wait.

945
00:52:41,393 --> 00:52:44,771
I hold a submerged U-boat,
010.

948
00:52:44,855 --> 00:52:47,065
Real close.
Less than 1,000 yards.

950
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:49,275
Goddamn resupply sub.
Trigger, what's our heading?

951
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,568
280, sir.

953
00:52:50,653 --> 00:52:53,571
Aye, right full rudder!
Steady on 010.

955
00:52:53,656 --> 00:52:56,950
Aye, sir! Right full rudder.
Steady on course 010, sir.

956
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:59,744
Tank, starboard back full.
Rabbit, get back to me.

958
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:01,788
Starboard back full. Aye, sir.

960
00:53:07,044 --> 00:53:10,171
Watch your depth.
She'll squat.
Rabbit!

962
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:11,824
Rabbit !

963
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:13,758
We got four fish.
Tubes are flooded.

964
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:15,843
But I can't open
the muzzle doors
until I equalize.

966
00:53:15,928 --> 00:53:18,137
I can't find the valve!
Wentz, help Rabbit!

968
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:21,849
Enemy submarine close aboard.
Torpedo in the water.
Torpedo in the water!

970
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:24,435
All right, belay that.
Wentz, stay where you are!

972
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,813
Hirsch, hotfoot it
to the torpedo room !

974
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,776
Helm, mark your head
every 10 degrees.
Aye, sir.

976
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,613
Now passing 320.
Turn, baby, turn. Turn !

978
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:42,412
Equalizing valves. Holy shit!
What's what? This is crazy.
I can't equalize the tubes!

981
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:45,540
What do you need?
Equalizing valves!

982
00:53:45,624 --> 00:53:47,125
Valves?
Equalizing valves!

984
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:48,876
Gyro?
No.

985
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:50,795
Drainage.
Some kind of drainage.
No.

988
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:53,715
Now passing 000.

990
00:53:54,049 --> 00:53:56,676
Swing, you bastard, swing.

992
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,221
Chief, stand by in case
we have to flood forward trim.

994
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:06,519
Impulse?
No.

995
00:54:06,603 --> 00:54:08,062
Differential.
Pressure differential?

997
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:10,857
These! Turn them !
This! Turn them !
Which way?

998
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:10,966
- Pressure differential? 
- That's it ! Turn!

999
00:54:11,175 --> 00:54:11,842
What meaning ?

1000
00:54:12,092 --> 00:54:14,094
Unlike needles 
of a watch

1001
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:22,660
Torpedo missed.
It's in our baffles.

1003
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:27,874
Two more torpedoes
in the water!

1005
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:31,878
Best bearing
to the U-boat, 010.

1007
00:54:32,129 --> 00:54:34,464
Aye, Rabbit,
get ready to fire a spread.

1010
00:54:34,548 --> 00:54:37,508
Tubes one and two.
Zero gyro. Fire!

1012
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,218
Rabbit, fire!

1013
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:40,412
Fire!

1014
00:54:43,474 --> 00:54:45,141
What's going on?
What is that?

1016
00:54:45,225 --> 00:54:46,434
Wrong one! Wrong one!

1018
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,145
The fish is stuck!
I must've missed
an interlock or something.

1020
00:54:49,229 --> 00:54:51,939
Rabbit, get those fish out
before they blow!

1022
00:54:52,024 --> 00:54:53,941
Look for "impulse air"
or "firing air."

1023
00:54:54,068 --> 00:54:56,277
That was "impulse" there
and there!

1024
00:54:53,717 --> 00:54:58,138
- Look for something like "propulsion" 
- It was there! And there!

1025
00:55:00,783 --> 00:55:03,368
One, two, away.
Lining up tubes three
and four.

1027
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:06,287
Three and four, fire!

1029
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,463
All fish running hot,
straight and normal.

1031
00:55:45,577 --> 00:55:47,328
I think they all missed, sir.

1033
00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:02,009
Shit.

1034
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:03,537
Holy shit!

1035
00:56:07,558 --> 00:56:09,434
U-boat's breaking up!

1037
00:56:10,602 --> 00:56:12,478
I hear bulkheads collapsing.

1039
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,860
The 33 boat, Mr. Tyler.

1040
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:20,554
The S-33!

1041
00:56:25,868 --> 00:56:28,411
Let's take her up
and look for survivors, Chief.

1043
00:56:28,537 --> 00:56:31,122
Give me some rise
on the planes!
Rise on the planes, aye.

1044
00:56:31,248 --> 00:56:32,707
Deploy main ballast!

1045
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,234
Orient the dive bars. 
Drive out ballasts

1046
00:56:55,397 --> 00:56:56,731
Gotcha.

1047
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:19,295
Oh, crap.

1048
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:20,614
Shit

1049
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:28,429
Help!

1050
00:57:29,932 --> 00:57:38,105
Help!

1051
00:58:13,225 --> 00:58:14,725
Do you speak English?

1053
00:58:16,186 --> 00:58:18,354
English.
Do you speak English?

1054
00:58:18,564 --> 00:58:20,648
What's your rank?

1055
00:58:21,174 --> 00:58:22,384
Your rank?

1056
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:24,402
What do you do?

1058
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,654
What's your job? Your job.

1060
00:58:27,072 --> 00:58:28,281
Job.

1061
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:38,165
You're an electrician. Good.

1063
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,127
You can help us
squeeze some more juice
out of them batteries.

1065
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:45,339
Sir, I see the skipper.

1066
00:58:45,699 --> 00:58:47,075
I see the Pasha!

1067
00:59:00,439 --> 00:59:01,897
Battery's dead.

1069
00:59:02,357 --> 00:59:05,026
Whatever juice was left
we used up when we maneuvered.

1071
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:07,903
- What about the diesels?
- Starboard's a wreck.

1073
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,864
We need to dry dock
to fix it.

1075
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:13,451
Portside diesel's the good
news. Whoever the Krauts
had wrenching on it. . .

1077
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,454
didn't know a piston head
from his sister's titty.

1079
00:59:16,538 --> 00:59:17,872
I think I can fix it.

1080
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:21,334
Okay, Tank.
Do what you can.

1082
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,127
Yes, sir.

1084
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,839
All right. Listen up.

1086
00:59:27,507 --> 00:59:29,550
We've decided on a course.

1088
00:59:30,218 --> 00:59:32,595
We're heading for England,
Land's End.

1090
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:35,723
It's the closest,
besides occupied France.

1092
00:59:37,142 --> 00:59:39,310
Rabbit,
how many torpedoes do we have?

1093
00:59:39,394 --> 00:59:42,146
Just one.
It's in the stern tube,
which is busted.

1095
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,482
The high pressure
line's bleeding air
from somewhere.

1097
00:59:44,566 --> 00:59:46,817
Sir?
Yeah, what is it, Trigger?

1098
00:59:46,943 --> 00:59:48,527
Can't we just use the radio?

1101
00:59:49,404 --> 00:59:51,614
Fire off a mayday
and wait for a rescue?

1103
00:59:51,948 --> 00:59:53,658
That's impossible.

1104
00:59:53,742 --> 00:59:56,994
If we transmit, the Germans
will direction-find
our position to a grid. . .

1106
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:58,788
where they're missing
two U-boats.

1108
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:03,250
If they even suspect we have
the Enigma, they will change
their entire coding system.

1110
01:00:03,335 --> 01:00:06,253
And that would
completely negate
the purpose of our mission.

1112
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:07,755
Mr. Tyler. . .

1113
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:10,132
if we head for England. . .

1114
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:13,052
we're gonna go
straight through
the western approaches.

1116
01:00:13,512 --> 01:00:17,181
He's right. I mean,
that's Jerry's backyard.

1118
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:18,683
Listen, guys.

1119
01:00:18,767 --> 01:00:19,892
It's full of U-boats.

1121
01:00:19,976 --> 01:00:22,269
And we've got nothing
to defend ourselves with.

1123
01:00:22,354 --> 01:00:24,522
Do you think
I got all the answers here?

1125
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:28,776
You think I know how we're
gonna get out of this mess?
I don't. I don't know how.

1128
01:00:29,986 --> 01:00:32,530
I say we use the radio.
Nobody asked you.

1130
01:00:32,614 --> 01:00:34,782
We use the radio
and take our goddamn chances.

1131
01:00:34,866 --> 01:00:36,033
Yeah.
I said, can it.

1133
01:00:36,118 --> 01:00:38,994
It's what the captain
would have done--
Captain's dead.

1135
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:00,326
This is crazy.

1137
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:02,953
This whole thing is crazy.

1139
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:05,706
Risking our lives
over a typewriter.

1141
01:02:05,957 --> 01:02:07,792
It's not
a typewriter.

1143
01:02:07,876 --> 01:02:10,127
The hell it ain't.
It's got buttons
like a typewriter.

1144
01:02:10,212 --> 01:02:11,462
Yeah, well, it's not.

1145
01:02:10,153 --> 01:02:11,529
Yes, she has keys

1146
01:02:11,546 --> 01:02:15,090
Yeah, well, whatever
it is, I say it's crazy we
get ourselves killed over it.

1148
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:17,426
The Navy says
it's important,
it's important.

1150
01:02:18,678 --> 01:02:21,472
The Navy says
it's more important
than you, him, me, fine.

1151
01:02:21,556 --> 01:02:23,224
We're gonna die trying.

1153
01:02:24,476 --> 01:02:27,520
And that ain't crazy.
That's our job.

1155
01:02:29,147 --> 01:02:31,398
Well, what I don't
seem to understand, Chief. . .

1156
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:33,400
is how come
you're not in charge?

1158
01:02:33,485 --> 01:02:36,946
Scuttlebutt is Dahlgren was
kicking Tyler out of the Navy
anyway, and everybody--

1160
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,534
You stow that shit
right now, sailor.

1162
01:02:41,618 --> 01:02:43,244
Lieutenant Tyler is
your commanding officer. . .

1163
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:45,955
and you will respect
that man as such.

1165
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:49,500
Do you understand?
Yes, Chief.

1167
01:03:37,382 --> 01:03:39,258
Look at them sons of bitches.

1169
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:43,429
You know my pop
was a fisherman?

1171
01:03:44,556 --> 01:03:48,559
He had this old 60-footer
he'd run all over the Gulf.

1173
01:03:48,643 --> 01:03:50,603
Noisy two-stroke diesel.

1175
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,189
Rotten to the gunnels,
that thing.

1177
01:03:54,399 --> 01:03:58,193
I could scrub that deck
three times a day,
and it still stunk like fish.

1179
01:04:00,363 --> 01:04:03,657
And I swore I'd never
skipper a boat like that,
Chief.

1181
01:04:06,995 --> 01:04:08,245
I saw myself. . .

1182
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:10,915
standing on the bridge
of a battleship.

1184
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,710
A real sea captain.

1186
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:18,839
Mr. Tyler,
permission to speak freely?

1188
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:21,216
Of course, Chief.

1190
01:04:21,843 --> 01:04:23,344
This is the Navy. . .

1192
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:28,182
where a commanding officer
is a mighty
and terrible thing.

1194
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:30,476
A man to be feared
and respected.

1196
01:04:30,685 --> 01:04:33,187
All knowing, all powerful.

1198
01:04:33,688 --> 01:04:37,775
Don't you dare say
what you said to the boys back
there again, "I don't know."

1200
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:41,111
Those three words
will kill a crew,
dead as a depth charge.

1202
01:04:43,031 --> 01:04:44,907
You're the skipper now.

1203
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:48,035
And the skipper
always knows what to do,
whether he does or not.

1204
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,353
You are the Pasha. The Pasha 
always knows what to do

1205
01:04:53,249 --> 01:04:56,085
Aircraft
off the port bow!
Shit!

1207
01:05:06,388 --> 01:05:09,181
Real sorry, sir.
It dropped right out
of the clouds.

1209
01:05:09,766 --> 01:05:11,976
Rabbit, Trigger,
stand by the flak gun.

1210
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,352
Sir.
Sir.

1211
01:05:11,584 --> 01:05:13,961
Rabbit, Trigger, the machine gun!

1212
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:17,856
It's German. Looks like
long-range reconnaissance.

1214
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:21,276
What the hell's
it doing way out here?

1216
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:29,368
Jesus, here it comes.
All right. Sit tight.

1218
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:33,330
As far as he knows, we're all
playing on the same team.
Everybody wave.

1221
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,416
Wave?

1222
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:39,169
Sir, we're sitting ducks.
If we shoot first, we can
blow them out of the sky.

1224
01:05:39,254 --> 01:05:41,755
We shoot and miss,
he's gonna radio us in.

1226
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,341
That plane's gonna be the
least of our problems.

1228
01:05:44,426 --> 01:05:46,635
This is crazy.
You're gonna get us killed.

1230
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:57,646
He's coming around.

1232
01:05:57,897 --> 01:05:59,231
He's coming around !

1233
01:06:04,446 --> 01:06:06,530
He's attacking !
For Christ's sake, Rabbit,
do something !

1235
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:09,074
Mazzola, shut up.
Rabbit, ignore him.
Do something !

1237
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:11,160
He's gonna strafe us, Rabbit!
He's coming right at us!

1238
01:06:11,244 --> 01:06:12,327
It's lined up! Do something !

1240
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:15,164
Acknowledge me, Seaman Parker.
What are you
waiting for?

1242
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,458
Yeah, Rabbit! Shoot him !
Seamen Parker,
I'm ordering you !

1243
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:20,085
Do not fire that weapon !
Get your finger off
that trigger!

1244
01:06:16,649 --> 01:06:20,111
- Drawn ! 
- I order you not to shoot!

1245
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,129
Pull the trigger!
Pull the trigger!

1247
01:06:22,464 --> 01:06:24,965
We're gonna die!
Do it! Do it!

1249
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:27,593
Come on ! Goddamn it,
can't you see him?

1250
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:36,977
What the hell
are you doing, huh?

1252
01:06:37,062 --> 01:06:39,313
This is not
a goddamn democracy!

1254
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:43,942
Mr. Tyler,
I see a mast on the horizon !

1256
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,075
Shit!
That's a Nazi destroyer.

1258
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,953
That plane
must have been running
a recon screen for it.

1260
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:59,917
Clear the bridge!
Chief, secure the diesel
and dive the ship!

1262
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:01,543
Dive the ship!
Aye, sir!

1264
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,519
We don't have
a green board, sir.
What's wrong?

1265
01:08:00,603 --> 01:08:01,603
The engine room's not ready.

1266
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:02,855
No power
on the starboard engine.

1268
01:08:02,939 --> 01:08:04,606
Vents won't open.
We lost hydraulics.

1270
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:08,068
Tank, secure the diesel
and rig the engine room
for dive!

1272
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:11,071
Tank, acknowledge!

1274
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:15,701
Goddamn it! Mazzola, go see
what the hell's going on
back there.

1276
01:09:25,188 --> 01:09:27,773
Drop it, you Nazi
son of a bitch ! Drop it!

1278
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:39,034
Goddamn it.

1279
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:42,579
I'm real sorry,
Mr. Tyler.

1281
01:09:42,997 --> 01:09:44,831
Took me right off my feet.

1283
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:48,543
Listen to me.
You've got to
secure the diesel.

1285
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:51,213
And find out
why the vent valves
won't open. Now!

1287
01:09:51,297 --> 01:09:53,799
Yes, sir.
Goddamn it!

1288
01:09:53,883 --> 01:09:57,261
Eddie, get this son of a bitch
out of here. Chain him up
to the bunks.

1289
01:09:57,345 --> 01:10:00,847
Make sure his hands
and feet are secure.
Put him into submission !

1291
01:10:01,015 --> 01:10:04,434
Lieutenant, we have
a big problem!
Take care of it, Eddie.

1294
01:10:04,793 --> 01:10:06,128
Do it, Eddie

1295
01:10:12,819 --> 01:10:14,403
Oh, shit.

1296
01:10:23,037 --> 01:10:26,206
Tell Tank to finish
those repairs. The destroyer
is sending a launch.

1298
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:28,333
He needs five minutes,
Mr. Tyler!

1300
01:10:28,418 --> 01:10:30,544
We don't have
five minutes, Chief.

1302
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:34,131
Lieutenant, the deck cannon.
If we fire a shell
below the water line. . . .

1304
01:10:34,215 --> 01:10:38,677
It wouldn't do
a goddamn thing. No, that tub
could take a hundred shells.

1307
01:10:39,053 --> 01:10:42,055
What we need
is a working torpedo,
which we do not have.

1309
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,641
Trigger, stand by
on the flak gun, and when
I give you the word. . .

1310
01:10:44,726 --> 01:10:46,143
turn that launch
into driftwood. All right?

1311
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:47,352
Yes, sir.

1313
01:10:48,062 --> 01:10:50,397
Gonna find out who we are
in about 60 seconds.

1315
01:10:55,236 --> 01:10:57,195
Trigger,
ready on that weapon?

1317
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,239
Chief, tell Tank
he has one minute. . .

1318
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:02,075
and get Wentz and Rabbit
up here with the machine gun.

1319
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:02,935
Tank has a minute. 
Send Wentz and Rabbit with a PM

1320
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:06,246
Hirsch, what'll happen
when they find out
we're not German?

1322
01:11:06,331 --> 01:11:09,916
After they shoot us as spies,
they'll radio
into headquarters.

1324
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:12,377
They'll tell them
the Enigma's been
compromised.

1326
01:11:14,172 --> 01:11:18,091
What if we take out
their radio, before they can
notify anyone about us?

1328
01:11:18,176 --> 01:11:21,094
How?
With that deck gun.

1330
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,264
It's gonna be
one hell of a shot,
but we can do it.

1333
01:11:24,515 --> 01:11:27,351
Then we dive like hell,
and we get under them quick.

1335
01:11:27,935 --> 01:11:31,855
We lure them a little bit
closer to the continent,
in range of Allied air cover.

1337
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:34,816
Then we call in
an air strike.
Mr. Tyler.

1339
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:36,777
Yeah, we call in
an air strike.

1341
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,405
Son of a bitch cut off
pressure to the hydraulics.

1343
01:11:40,573 --> 01:11:42,407
We need to find
the stop valve.

1344
01:11:42,474 --> 01:11:44,101
We must find the stop

1345
01:11:48,998 --> 01:11:50,207
Damn !

1346
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:55,337
See that structure
topside just aft
of the flying bridge. . .

1347
01:11:55,421 --> 01:11:56,880
with the big antenna
sticking out of it?

1349
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,799
Yes, sir.
That's the radio shack.

1350
01:11:58,883 --> 01:12:00,217
You and Wentz
get on the deck gun.

1352
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:04,054
On my command, I want you
to put a shell right through
the goddamn porthole.

1355
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:08,058
Get to it, gentlemen.
Get to it.

1357
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:09,476
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

1358
01:12:19,344 --> 01:12:20,846
Shall we send you a rope?

1359
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:22,139
Right now

1360
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:25,392
This is weird

1361
01:12:28,496 --> 01:12:31,081
Tell them to go away,
Mr. Hirsch.

1364
01:12:31,606 --> 01:12:32,691
Hands up

1365
01:12:40,031 --> 01:12:41,199
Tackle!

1367
01:12:42,427 --> 01:12:43,844
Talk to me, Rabbit!

1368
01:12:43,928 --> 01:12:46,012
Deck gun manned
and ready in all respects,
sir.

1369
01:12:46,097 --> 01:12:47,264
Fire.

1370
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:47,456
- Rabbit! 
- Ready to fire!

1371
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:48,832
Fire!

1372
01:13:04,115 --> 01:13:05,365
Clear the deck.

1373
01:13:05,807 --> 01:13:07,392
Evacuate the bridge!

1374
01:13:14,816 --> 01:13:16,943
Quickly ! They shoot us

1375
01:13:17,152 --> 01:13:17,861
Who ?

1376
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:20,947
The U-Boot. 
They destroyed our radio

1377
01:13:33,019 --> 01:13:35,061
Dive! Dive! Dive!

1379
01:13:48,367 --> 01:13:49,910
Come on.
Why aren't we diving?

1380
01:13:49,994 --> 01:13:51,703
Repairs aren't complete, sir.

1382
01:13:52,038 --> 01:13:53,413
- Eddie, man the planes.
- Aye, sir!

1383
01:13:53,498 --> 01:13:56,166
Tank, all ahead full.
Aye, sir! Manning the planes!

1386
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,751
All ahead full, aye!

1387
01:13:58,586 --> 01:14:01,505
Nice shot, Rabbit.
That radio's history.

1389
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:14,476
We're heading
right towards them.
That's right.

1391
01:14:14,936 --> 01:14:17,812
Her deck guns can't get to us,
if we're in close enough.

1393
01:14:17,897 --> 01:14:20,690
Let's hope we can dive
and clear her keel.

1395
01:14:34,497 --> 01:14:35,872
That's it.

1397
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:38,124
Hydraulics restored.

1398
01:14:38,209 --> 01:14:40,961
Thank you, Tank.
That did it.
We're going under.

1400
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:53,431
Passing five meters.

1402
01:15:02,817 --> 01:15:04,442
Passing 10 meters.

1403
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:06,177
10 meters

1404
01:15:11,242 --> 01:15:12,826
15 meters.

1405
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:14,561
15 meters

1406
01:15:41,689 --> 01:15:42,939
20 meters.

1407
01:15:43,381 --> 01:15:44,591
20 meters

1408
01:16:19,143 --> 01:16:20,894
Trigger,
left full rudder.

1410
01:16:25,066 --> 01:16:26,858
Tank, all ahead two-thirds.

1412
01:16:36,744 --> 01:16:38,203
Contact maneuvering.

1413
01:16:38,436 --> 01:16:39,604
He maneuvers

1414
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:43,750
Heavy cavitation.

1416
01:16:45,795 --> 01:16:47,087
Splashes.

1417
01:16:47,445 --> 01:16:48,321
Grenadage

1418
01:16:58,456 --> 01:16:59,999
Close intervals

1419
01:17:02,544 --> 01:17:04,045
Get ready to grenade

1420
01:17:05,046 --> 01:17:06,881
Adjust depth 25

1421
01:18:01,537 --> 01:18:03,997
Step away from that bulkhead,
Mr. Hirsch.

1423
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:09,878
The shock wave from
one of these explosions
can snap your spine.

1425
01:18:14,842 --> 01:18:16,468
Chief. . .

1426
01:18:17,553 --> 01:18:19,387
you ever been depth charged?

1427
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,680
Once. . .

1428
01:18:19,287 --> 01:18:21,414
Have you ever been pomegranated?

1430
01:18:21,682 --> 01:18:23,016
off Murmansk. . .

1431
01:18:23,642 --> 01:18:25,143
back in World War I.

1433
01:18:26,312 --> 01:18:30,356
One charge came so close,
it rattled four teeth out
of the skipper's head.

1435
01:18:41,994 --> 01:18:43,369
Wasn't even close.

1436
01:18:43,644 --> 01:18:45,188
It was far

1437
01:18:51,212 --> 01:18:54,380
Control, the starboard
e-motor's seized up.

1439
01:18:54,673 --> 01:18:56,508
The German must have
sabotaged it.

1440
01:18:56,592 --> 01:18:57,967
Goddamn it.

1441
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:58,284
The German will have sabotaged it

1442
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:05,892
There's no way we make it
to Allied air cover
creeping along on one shaft.

1444
01:21:02,509 --> 01:21:04,844
Eddie, help Chief.

1445
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:06,871
Help the Chef

1446
01:21:07,389 --> 01:21:08,640
Yes, sir.

1447
01:21:16,065 --> 01:21:17,941
Mr. Chief, I got that.

1449
01:21:20,653 --> 01:21:24,197
Tank, you alive back there?

1451
01:21:24,597 --> 01:21:25,639
still alive ?

1452
01:21:25,991 --> 01:21:27,241
Yes, sir.

1453
01:21:27,493 --> 01:21:28,785
Good.

1454
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:32,205
Port ahead two-thirds.

1457
01:21:33,707 --> 01:21:36,292
Port ahead two-thirds.
Aye, sir.

1458
01:22:02,403 --> 01:22:03,611
Tank. . .

1459
01:22:04,321 --> 01:22:06,114
can you fix the stern tube?

1460
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:07,681
Can you fix the tube?

1461
01:22:07,908 --> 01:22:09,617
I don't know, Mr. Tyler.

1463
01:22:10,244 --> 01:22:12,245
I don't want
an "I don't know."

1465
01:22:13,372 --> 01:22:17,125
Can you fix
the torpedo tube? Yes or no?

1467
01:22:20,045 --> 01:22:21,879
Yes, sir. I think I can.

1469
01:22:22,881 --> 01:22:24,132
Thank you, Tank.

1470
01:22:24,216 --> 01:22:25,425
Chief. . .

1471
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:27,927
make depth 160 meters.

1473
01:22:32,224 --> 01:22:34,392
That's more than 500 feet.

1475
01:22:37,062 --> 01:22:38,813
Take us down, Chief.

1476
01:22:38,879 --> 01:22:40,422
Got to get down, Chief

1477
01:22:41,775 --> 01:22:43,067
Aye, sir.

1478
01:22:44,111 --> 01:22:45,862
160 meters.

1480
01:22:46,155 --> 01:22:47,989
20 degrees dive,
both planes.

1482
01:22:48,073 --> 01:22:51,117
20 degrees dive,
aye, sir.
20 degrees dive, aye, sir.

1483
01:22:51,201 --> 01:22:53,161
Mr. Tyler, sir. . .

1485
01:22:54,038 --> 01:22:56,706
you planning on
going up against
a destroyer with. . .

1487
01:22:56,790 --> 01:23:00,043
only one fish in the tube
and a busted motor?

1489
01:23:00,377 --> 01:23:01,836
Yes, I am, Eddie.

1491
01:23:02,212 --> 01:23:05,131
How wise is that, Lieutenant?
Not very.

1493
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:07,300
But have a look. Chief.

1495
01:23:07,408 --> 01:23:08,993
But come see

1496
01:23:09,303 --> 01:23:12,638
There is no way
a two-knot submarine,
can get in firing position. . .

1498
01:23:12,723 --> 01:23:16,642
against a 30-knot destroyer,
unless we go deep.

1499
01:23:17,311 --> 01:23:18,728
At 160 meters. . .

1500
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,794
unless you sink

1501
01:23:18,812 --> 01:23:21,773
we can shoot out
a bunch of junk
from the forward tubes.

1503
01:23:21,857 --> 01:23:24,442
It will resurface
and create a debris field.

1505
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:27,236
Now the destroyer's gonna go
to the center
of that debris field. . .

1506
01:23:27,321 --> 01:23:29,864
shut off its engines
to make it real nice
and quiet. . .

1508
01:23:29,948 --> 01:23:32,742
and do an acoustic search,
to make sure we're dead.

1510
01:23:32,826 --> 01:23:35,244
But we're not.
See, we're here. . .

1512
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:38,623
on our way
up to periscope depth.

1515
01:23:39,124 --> 01:23:41,250
All right,
principle of ascent velocity.

1517
01:23:41,335 --> 01:23:44,754
We let our positive buoyancy
pull us up,
and away from the destroyer.

1519
01:23:44,838 --> 01:23:48,257
And when we surface,
we'll be showing it
our ass at 700 yards.

1521
01:23:48,634 --> 01:23:52,595
That is a perfect setup
for a stern shot
on a stationary target.

1522
01:23:52,763 --> 01:23:53,763
Boom.

1523
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:54,538
Perfect position for 
rear firing on a fixed target

1524
01:23:54,598 --> 01:23:56,849
It don't get
much prettier than that.

1526
01:23:58,977 --> 01:24:00,520
All right, Mr. Tyler.

1528
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:02,313
All right.

1529
01:24:02,689 --> 01:24:04,232
Passing 130 meters.

1530
01:24:04,316 --> 01:24:05,650
Very well.

1532
01:24:05,776 --> 01:24:09,779
Rabbit, I need you
to load Mazzola's body
into tube three. . .

1534
01:24:09,863 --> 01:24:13,032
and put an escape jacket
onto him
to make sure he floats.

1536
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:16,285
Gonna shoot him out
like garbage?

1538
01:24:24,044 --> 01:24:26,379
His body is gonna save
our lives.

1540
01:24:28,006 --> 01:24:29,882
I'll say a few words
for him.

1542
01:24:30,342 --> 01:24:32,009
Hirsch, go with Rabbit.

1544
01:24:32,302 --> 01:24:34,804
Eddie, can you man
both planes?
Yes, sir.

1546
01:24:35,389 --> 01:24:36,722
Mr. Tyler.
Yeah.

1547
01:24:37,558 --> 01:24:39,934
If you can't take out
that destroyer. . .

1549
01:24:40,018 --> 01:24:42,520
the danger is not that
some of us may die. . .

1551
01:24:42,688 --> 01:24:44,605
but that some of us
may live.

1553
01:24:47,985 --> 01:24:50,570
These men have seen
and heard things. . .

1555
01:24:51,029 --> 01:24:53,489
that must not be revealed
to the enemy.

1557
01:24:54,408 --> 01:24:55,700
Our secrets. . .

1559
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:58,578
such as our
radar capabilities. . .

1561
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:01,581
and our understanding
of German encryption.

1563
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:07,003
If we fall into German hands
alive, we will be tortured
without mercy.

1565
01:25:07,629 --> 01:25:10,047
Either you succeed
in sinking that ship. . .

1567
01:25:11,091 --> 01:25:14,385
or you must see to it
that none of us survive. . .

1569
01:25:14,761 --> 01:25:16,095
to be captured.

1570
01:25:16,453 --> 01:25:17,830
to be captured

1571
01:25:48,921 --> 01:25:50,880
We commend his soul
to God. . .

1573
01:25:52,174 --> 01:25:54,217
and commit his body
to the deep.

1575
01:25:57,703 --> 01:25:59,580
Port all!

1576
01:26:02,184 --> 01:26:05,019
Mr. Tyler,
contact is zigging.

1577
01:26:05,419 --> 01:26:06,920
It zigzags

1578
01:26:08,815 --> 01:26:10,066
Splashes.

1579
01:26:10,549 --> 01:26:11,341
Grenadage

1580
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:13,861
Contact getting closer.

1582
01:26:15,155 --> 01:26:16,489
More splashes.

1583
01:26:17,014 --> 01:26:18,473
More pomegranates

1584
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,418
Tank. . .

1585
01:26:30,003 --> 01:26:32,713
line out to pump engine
room bilge to sea.

1586
01:26:33,006 --> 01:26:34,298
Yes, sir.

1587
01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:34,531
Water must be removed 
from the bilges of the machines

1588
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:50,314
Rabbit. . .

1589
01:26:52,859 --> 01:26:54,360
fire the tubes.

1590
01:26:54,593 --> 01:26:55,844
Hunt the tubes

1591
01:26:56,238 --> 01:26:57,697
Bye, Mazzola.

1592
01:28:13,565 --> 01:28:15,524
They setting them charges
too shallow.

1594
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,315
Secure that air valve.

1596
01:29:52,706 --> 01:29:54,248
Chief. . .

1597
01:29:54,332 --> 01:29:55,708
what's our depth?

1599
01:29:57,169 --> 01:29:59,170
160 meters.

1601
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:02,298
Zero the planes.

1602
01:30:02,382 --> 01:30:04,049
Zero the planes.
Zero the planes.

1604
01:30:04,301 --> 01:30:05,551
Splashes!

1605
01:30:06,117 --> 01:30:07,327
Grenadage!

1606
01:30:08,638 --> 01:30:10,431
They're too close together!

1608
01:30:11,224 --> 01:30:13,225
I can't count them.

1610
01:30:22,277 --> 01:30:23,527
Chief. . .

1611
01:30:25,822 --> 01:30:27,823
take us to 200 meters.

1613
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:32,661
We're gonna get under
these damn things.

1615
01:30:36,124 --> 01:30:37,374
Chief. . .

1616
01:30:38,293 --> 01:30:40,419
take us to 200 meters.

1618
01:30:47,636 --> 01:30:48,928
Aye, sir.

1619
01:30:55,185 --> 01:30:57,603
Making my depth 200 meters.

1621
01:30:58,104 --> 01:31:00,272
10 degrees dive, both planes.

1623
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,775
10 degrees dive,
both planes.
10 degrees dive. Aye.

1624
01:31:25,882 --> 01:31:27,758
170 meters.

1626
01:31:40,772 --> 01:31:41,981
Tank. . .

1627
01:31:42,357 --> 01:31:44,900
what's the status
on the stern torpedo tube?

1629
01:31:46,611 --> 01:31:50,114
There's a couple things wrong.
I can operate the muzzle door
now. . .

1631
01:31:50,198 --> 01:31:52,283
but I'm still working
on the impulse air.

1633
01:31:52,367 --> 01:31:54,118
180 meters.

1634
01:31:54,142 --> 01:31:56,102
180 meters

1635
01:31:57,038 --> 01:32:00,207
Mr. Tyler,
depth gauge back here
says 180 meters.

1637
01:32:01,334 --> 01:32:03,711
Thanks, Tank. I know.

1639
01:32:05,463 --> 01:32:06,922
Keep working.

1640
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:08,281
Keep working

1641
01:32:19,311 --> 01:32:21,186
190 meters.

1643
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:43,542
200 meters.

1645
01:32:45,045 --> 01:32:46,462
Zero the planes.

1646
01:32:46,546 --> 01:32:48,881
Zero the planes, aye.
Zero the planes.

1648
01:33:51,778 --> 01:33:53,779
Mary, mother of God.

1650
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:01,620
Those Krauts sure know
how to build a boat.

1652
01:34:10,672 --> 01:34:12,089
Chief, take us up!

1654
01:34:12,215 --> 01:34:16,260
Blowing negative!
Planes full rise!
Clockwise, Hirsch ! Clockwise!

1656
01:34:18,805 --> 01:34:20,305
- All right!
- Hurry up!

1657
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:23,225
Go! Go!
Move it, move it!

1659
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,479
Chief, are you seeing this?

1661
01:34:34,446 --> 01:34:38,615
Needle's off the scale.
We have to blow
main ballast tanks.

1663
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:39,950
Do it, Chief!

1664
01:34:40,057 --> 01:34:41,184
Do it, Chef!

1665
01:34:58,052 --> 01:34:59,678
She's still going down !

1667
01:35:00,054 --> 01:35:02,181
Ballast tanks are bone dry.

1668
01:35:02,265 --> 01:35:04,141
I'm gonna try the trim tanks.

1669
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:05,833
The ballasts are empty! 
I try the compensators

1670
01:35:11,191 --> 01:35:12,524
Come on, come on !

1671
01:35:24,579 --> 01:35:26,580
She's going up.
She's going up.

1673
01:35:43,348 --> 01:35:45,557
Mr. Tyler, we're coming up.

1675
01:35:46,017 --> 01:35:48,477
But I've lost control
over the ballast tanks.

1676
01:35:48,561 --> 01:35:50,270
I can't stop our ascent.

1678
01:35:51,606 --> 01:35:53,440
Where are we
with the stern torpedo?

1680
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:54,900
Piping's damaged.

1681
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:58,862
There's a break in the air
line, so there's no pressure
to launch the torpedo.

1684
01:35:58,947 --> 01:36:02,658
I tried to bypass the leak,
but it's way back
in the bilge underwater.

1686
01:36:02,742 --> 01:36:05,494
There's no way
to reach it. I can't fit.

1688
01:36:05,745 --> 01:36:08,330
Think somebody else
could do it?
I don't know.

1690
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:11,291
Maybe somebody smaller.

1692
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:14,211
That's Rabbit or Trigger.

1694
01:36:14,295 --> 01:36:16,588
Coming up on 200 meters.

1696
01:36:17,465 --> 01:36:18,924
You gotta pick one.

1697
01:36:19,031 --> 01:36:20,282
Must choose

1698
01:36:27,058 --> 01:36:28,100
Trigger.

1699
01:36:28,685 --> 01:36:29,935
Trigger. . .

1700
01:36:30,603 --> 01:36:31,979
lay aft with Tank.

1701
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,754
Join Tank

1702
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,107
Move it, son.

1704
01:36:36,276 --> 01:36:37,776
You got a job to do.

1705
01:36:37,842 --> 01:36:39,260
You have a job

1706
01:36:46,703 --> 01:36:49,454
See here,
we got no air pressure
to fire the torpedo.

1708
01:36:50,123 --> 01:36:52,249
One of these pipes is busted
and it's leaking air.

1710
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:54,543
How am I gonna find it?
You'll see bubbles
coming out.

1711
01:36:54,627 --> 01:36:56,044
A lot of them.

1713
01:36:56,296 --> 01:37:00,132
Find the isolation valve
aft of the leak,
and crank it down.

1715
01:37:00,633 --> 01:37:02,217
Got it?
Yeah.

1717
01:37:03,636 --> 01:37:06,179
I rigged this hose
so you can breathe through it.

1719
01:37:06,264 --> 01:37:09,641
Now listen to me.
As soon as you finish,
you get out of there.

1721
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:11,643
Okay?
Yeah.

1722
01:37:33,082 --> 01:37:34,374
I can hear her.

1723
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,025
I hear it

1724
01:37:36,669 --> 01:37:38,378
Making slow turns.

1726
01:37:43,718 --> 01:37:45,552
She just stopped her screws.

1728
01:37:48,932 --> 01:37:50,766
I think they see the debris.

1730
01:37:54,145 --> 01:37:55,854
I think they're buying it.

1732
01:37:56,147 --> 01:37:58,023
180 meters.

1734
01:37:59,484 --> 01:38:02,527
Chief, can you slow
our ascent some?
We are not ready.

1736
01:38:03,363 --> 01:38:04,571
Can't, sir.

1738
01:38:05,823 --> 01:38:07,908
We got a one-way ticket
topside.

1740
01:38:10,662 --> 01:38:14,206
If we surface without
a torpedo to fire, we're dead.

1742
01:38:52,745 --> 01:38:54,162
There's two air leaks.

1743
01:38:54,247 --> 01:38:55,998
I got one,
but the other one's
way in the back.

1745
01:38:56,082 --> 01:38:58,083
I need some more
slack on the hose
to get to it.

1746
01:38:58,167 --> 01:38:59,459
That's all there is.

1748
01:38:59,544 --> 01:39:00,627
Shit.

1750
01:39:22,316 --> 01:39:24,776
150 meters.

1752
01:39:28,781 --> 01:39:30,198
I hear Morse code.

1753
01:39:30,389 --> 01:39:31,598
You morse!

1754
01:39:32,076 --> 01:39:34,786
What the hell is it?
Are they signaling us?

1756
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:36,770
Are they talking to us?

1757
01:39:43,046 --> 01:39:44,755
What's it saying, Wentz?

1759
01:39:45,256 --> 01:39:47,632
"I am U-571. Destroy me."

1761
01:39:59,103 --> 01:40:01,480
Coming up on 90 meters.

1763
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:20,999
Sir, she's started
her engines again.

1764
01:40:21,273 --> 01:40:23,358
The propellers take off again

1765
01:40:25,546 --> 01:40:28,465
No go, Mr. Tyler.
He can't reach.

1767
01:40:36,682 --> 01:40:37,849
Trigger. . .

1768
01:40:37,934 --> 01:40:40,769
in one minute
we're gonna hit the surface.
Do you understand me?

1770
01:40:40,853 --> 01:40:43,355
Now you've got to
go back in there and try.

1772
01:40:43,606 --> 01:40:45,690
I wouldn't ask you
if our lives
didn't depend on it.

1774
01:40:45,775 --> 01:40:49,361
Sorry, sir. I can't reach it.
No, no, Trigger.
Now listen to me.

1776
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:51,094
Listen to me

1777
01:40:51,489 --> 01:40:54,241
You can reach it,
and you will.

1779
01:40:55,535 --> 01:40:58,120
Now you are gonna close
that valve.
I can't!

1781
01:40:58,204 --> 01:41:00,747
God damn it,
you're the only chance
we've got.

1783
01:41:05,336 --> 01:41:07,963
Now you're gonna
go back down in that bilge. . .

1785
01:41:08,214 --> 01:41:11,007
and you're gonna
do your job, sailor.

1787
01:41:23,437 --> 01:41:25,730
Report to me the instant
that torpedo's ready to fire.

1788
01:41:25,815 --> 01:41:27,065
Yes, sir.

1789
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:27,631
Call me when the torpedo 
is ready

1790
01:41:30,027 --> 01:41:31,236
30 meters.

1792
01:41:32,196 --> 01:41:34,364
- Talk to me, Wentz.
- Destroyer is underway.

1794
01:41:34,448 --> 01:41:37,576
Steady bearing.
They're closing our position.

1797
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:41,079
Shit! Come on, Trigger!

1798
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:43,331
20 meters.

1799
01:41:43,416 --> 01:41:45,333
Hold on. We're gonna surface.

1802
01:41:45,418 --> 01:41:46,793
Raising scope.

1803
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:48,568
I take out the periscope

1804
01:41:56,888 --> 01:41:58,096
Got her.

1806
01:41:58,848 --> 01:42:00,640
She's heading right for us.

1808
01:42:01,434 --> 01:42:04,477
elm, come right 10 degrees.
Helm, come right
10 degrees. Aye, sir!

1810
01:42:04,604 --> 01:42:06,938
Watch your bow planes.
Aye, sir.
Watching my bow planes.

1812
01:42:07,023 --> 01:42:09,399
Tank, start the diesel.
All ahead full.

1814
01:42:18,284 --> 01:42:20,202
Port diesel ahead full.

1816
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:43,892
Shit, they've got us
bracketed.

1818
01:42:45,645 --> 01:42:46,937
Incoming.

1819
01:42:47,044 --> 01:42:47,794
Shells!

1820
01:42:54,445 --> 01:42:56,279
We're hit!
We're hit!

1822
01:42:56,906 --> 01:42:59,658
Wentz, get in here.
Eddie,
secure that hatch.

1824
01:43:18,678 --> 01:43:20,470
Tube still not ready.

1826
01:43:27,144 --> 01:43:30,522
Request permission
to abandon ship.
Not yet, Chief.

1828
01:43:30,712 --> 01:43:31,588
Not yet !

1829
01:43:52,628 --> 01:43:55,588
Control, answer.
Torpedo now ready
in all respects.

1831
01:43:55,673 --> 01:43:57,799
Hold us right there, Rabbit.
Hold us steady right here.

1833
01:43:57,883 --> 01:44:00,051
Steady on bearing
80 degrees, sir.

1835
01:44:01,721 --> 01:44:02,846
Fire.

1836
01:44:03,286 --> 01:44:04,079
Fire!

1837
01:44:04,307 --> 01:44:06,308
Tank, fire right now
or we die!

1839
01:44:06,851 --> 01:44:07,892
Come on.

1840
01:44:12,398 --> 01:44:13,773
Okay, come on.

1841
01:44:19,844 --> 01:44:21,388
A torpedo!

1842
01:44:24,057 --> 01:44:25,559
All starboard!

1843
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,128
That blew them right in half.

1845
01:45:28,641 --> 01:45:31,643
Hell, Mr. Tyler,
if you ever need a chief. . .

1847
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,521
I'd go to sea
with you anytime.

1849
01:45:36,357 --> 01:45:37,732
Thank you, Chief.

1850
01:45:48,035 --> 01:45:49,452
Tank, you okay?

1851
01:45:49,768 --> 01:45:51,061
It's okay ?

1852
01:45:52,957 --> 01:45:54,290
Trigger drowned.

1853
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:55,690
Trigger drowned

1854
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:07,053
That kid didn't give up,
did he?

1856
01:46:11,308 --> 01:46:13,101
Neither did you, Mr. Tyler.

1858
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:27,532
We can't keep her afloat
much longer, sir.

1860
01:46:36,876 --> 01:46:38,376
Let's abandon ship.

1861
01:48:14,181 --> 01:48:15,723
Mr. Tyler. Sir.
