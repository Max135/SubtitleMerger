1
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:47,154
There he is.
Hey, Andy! Where you been?
It's an all-hands function.

2
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,573
Come here.
I want you to meet Joanie.
Joanie, this is Andy Tyler.

3
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,492
Hello. Hi.
He's my best friend.

4
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:53,577
We went to Annapolis together.
Nice to meet you, Joanie.

5
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,287
Hey, I got you
one of Larson's stogies.

6
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:58,123
To our Navy's
next sub skipper.
Thank you.

7
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:02,836
Lieutenant.
You gonna hoist up a few beers
with the enlisted boys later?

8
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:05,130
You got it, Griggs.
All right.

9
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,928
Mr. Tyler. Mr. Tyler.

10
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,555
My mom is here visiting.
Can I bring her over
to meet you?

11
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,140
Sure thing, Trigger.
Sure thing.

12
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:16,892
That's the lieutenant
I was talking about.

13
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,442
Lieutenant Tyler!

14
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:29,613
Hello there, Prudence,
Louise. Mrs. Dahlgren,
Captain.

15
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:33,075
Where's your date, Andy?
It's not like you
to arrive stag like this.

16
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,412
I'm afraid I couldn't get one
on such short notice, ma'am.

17
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,372
Captain, could I have
a word with you?

18
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:41,583
Certainly. Darling,
will you excuse us?
Okay.

19
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:42,793
Be right back.

20
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:59,476
I didn't get my boat.
I know.

21
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:03,564
And with all due respect, sir,
there's only one way
that could have happened.

22
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,692
And that's if you withheld
your recommendation.

23
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:10,779
That's right.
I just don't think
you're ready.

24
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:13,991
What do you mean,
I'm not ready?

25
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:17,119
Sir, I have worked my tail off
on the S-33.

26
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,246
I'm qualified in every area
and then some.

27
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,248
No executive officer
has higher marks than I do,
Captain.

28
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,458
Andy!

29
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:27,546
You're just not ready
to take on a command
of your own.

30
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,761
Now I've made my decision.
It's done.

31
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:41,351
Mr. Tyler.
How you doing, sir?

32
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:46,315
Having a good time?
Hell, yeah, Chief.

33
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:50,611
How about you?
Looking forward
to getting underway.

34
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:53,197
I'm a sea dog.
Need some salt, sir.

35
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:59,119
He torpedoed me, Chief.

36
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,623
Nine months aboard the S-33. . .

37
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,709
doing the best job I know how.

38
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:08,879
Doing everything once
and then doing it again.

39
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:12,466
Just to make sure
I didn't miss anything
the first time.

40
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:17,012
You'll get your chance, sir.
There's other commands
in the Navy.

41
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:22,684
You knew?

42
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:27,397
Didn't warn me.

43
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:32,653
Ain't my place, sir.

44
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,073
CIub secured!
Time to go!

45
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,411
et's go. Get out.
Everyone out.

46
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,747
This club's secured.
Gotta go.

47
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,959
What's the meaning
of this, Sergeant?

48
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:50,212
You the senior man?
That's right.
I'm the XO of the S-33.

49
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:54,258
These men have
a 48-hour liberty pass.
No, sir, not no more.

50
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:42,723
What the hell are those
yard birds doing to my boat?

51
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:45,809
Looks like a goddamn
Nazi submarine.

52
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:49,479
Hey, Andy.
This is a fine Navy day.

53
00:13:53,985 --> 00:13:57,863
They wouldn't give me
five minutes to consummate
my marriage. Five minutes!

54
00:13:57,989 --> 00:14:01,241
What's going on here?
Hell if I know.
Put your cover on.

55
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,618
Yes, sir.

56
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:06,163
Mr. Tyler, call the crew
to quarters.
Aye, Captain.

57
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:10,584
Quarters! Everybody fall in !
Let's get in formation now!

58
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:14,171
Let's go! Now! Formation !

59
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:18,592
Repair Crew 3,
muster with First Lieutenant.

60
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:21,428
Repair Crew 3,
muster with First Lieutenant.

61
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:24,473
Captain Dahlgren,
all crew members present
and accounted for, sir!

62
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:26,642
Very well. At ease.

63
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:32,773
I'm sorry your liberty's
been cut short,
but our schedule's changed.

64
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:37,527
We have two hours
to get stowed for sea
and set the maneuvering watch.

65
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,988
Mr. Larson,
have your torpedomen. . .

66
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:41,782
load the tubes
with their four best fish.

67
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:45,577
Mr. Emmett,
warm up the diesels
and line up a battery charge.

68
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:50,165
Mr. Tyler, we have dry stores,
ordnance and perishables
to get below decks.

69
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:53,335
Gentlemen, it's our turn.

70
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:56,171
That's all.

71
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,923
Attention !

72
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:01,718
Aye, Captain.

73
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:07,265
Crew dismissed.
You heard the man.
Stores load.

74
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:11,395
You got six seconds
to get on your boondockers
and dungarees and turn to.

75
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,397
Mr. Tyler, is this for real,
or is it a drill?

76
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,399
I mean, you know,
"it's our turn,"
what does that mean?

77
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,609
I thought we had
a two-day liberty pass.
What's going on?

78
00:15:17,694 --> 00:15:21,238
I don't know. I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

79
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:23,573
Get your jobs done now.

80
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:26,368
AII off-going
duty officers,
report to the dock....

81
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:29,913
Captain Dahlgren,
could you fill me in
on what's going on, sir?

82
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:32,457
I mean,
we're obviously not going
to the Caribbean station.

83
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,168
No, we're not.
We're going on a special op.

84
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:39,006
You'll be briefed
with Mr. Emmett and Mr. Larson
once we get underway.

85
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,675
Aye, sir.
Andy, listen to me.

86
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:44,177
I'm gonna need the very best
from you on this run. . .

87
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:47,180
regardless of any differences
you may have with me.

88
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,099
Are we clear on that?

89
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,727
Yes, sir.
Good.

90
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,982
Now go find Radioman Wentz
and quietly escort him
to the materiel office.

91
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:08,243
Mr. Tyler. How are you, son?
I'm fine, Admiral Duke.

92
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:13,206
What brings you up here?
He does.
That's Lieutenant Hirsch.

93
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,167
He's gonna be
riding your boat.

94
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:19,796
You're not working for SUBLANT
on this run. Mr. Hirsch
has operational control.

95
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:23,133
He's the boss.
Anything he wants, he gets.

96
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,056
All right.

97
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:32,684
Is this him?

98
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:54,456
Yes, sir.

99
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:34,704
He'll do.
Thank you, Wentz.
That's all for now.

100
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:36,748
Lieutenant,
prepare the boat
to get underway.

101
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,251
Aye, sir. Admiral.

102
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,887
Mr. Tyler, please,
don't tell the other guys
I'm half German.

103
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,890
They'll hate me.

104
00:17:55,518 --> 00:17:57,477
Yeah, sure thing, Wentz.

105
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,151
Repair Crew 3,
muster with First Lieutenant.

106
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:07,320
Repair Crew 3,
muster with First Lieutenant.

107
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:18,248
Will the Duty Officer
break to the paint shop.

108
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,750
Duty Officer
to the paint shop.

109
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:25,005
You all right, Mr. Tyler?

110
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:31,136
Tiptop, Eddie. Tiptop.

111
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:37,559
Wanna thank you
for that liberty pass.

112
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:42,564
My girl thanks you, too.

113
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,193
You're a good man,
Mr. Tyler.

114
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:49,321
Heart's in the right place.

115
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,115
Just need to give it
some time.

116
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,039
Yeah, I heard about
what happened to you.

117
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,920
That's one of the advantages
of being seen
and not being seen.

118
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:10,008
You'd be surprised
some of the shit
we mess stewards hear.

119
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:14,054
Boy, don't go dropping
my eggs. Now look.

120
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:15,805
Damn. Excuse me, Mr. Tyler.

121
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,227
Look, all you got to do is
pick them up with both hands,
boy, both hands!

122
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,022
Tyler!

123
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,734
When the hell were you
gonna tell me? I hear
about this from the chief?

124
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:30,820
What do you want me to say?
He shit-canned me.

125
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:33,073
Now you're gonna transfer
to another boat.

126
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:35,200
Excuse me.
Either one of you two. . .

127
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:36,993
tell me where I can find
the exec of this thing?

128
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:40,080
Yeah, that's me, mac.
We'll have your truck
unloaded here shortly.

129
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:41,373
Well, you'll unload it now.

130
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:44,084
Here's the manifest.
Let's get those crates
below decks.

131
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:45,293
Who the hell are you?

132
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,671
Marine Major Coonan,
Office of Naval Intelligence.

133
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,422
I'm going to sea
with you boys.

134
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:53,677
That's my luggage.
You got a problem,
talk to Mr. Hirsch.

135
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:12,946
Clear!

136
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,031
- Cast off all lines forward!
- Cast off forward !

137
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,700
Take in all lines aft.

138
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:18,243
Cast off aft!

139
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,955
Rudder amidships.

140
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,124
All ahead one-third.

141
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,251
All ahead one-third!

142
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,764
Bridge hatch shut.

143

Engine room,
secure the diesels.

144
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:24,100
Switch the ship propulsion
to the battery.

145
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:26,728
Engine room,
secure diesels, switch
propulsion to the battery.

146
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,855
- Main induction indicates shut.
- Aye.

147
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,398
Green board, Skipper.
Very well.

148
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:33,318
Passing the 100-fathom curve.
On course, on time, sir.

149
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:36,363
Engine room reports
secured diesels, propulsion
switched to battery.

150
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:40,116
Very well.
All ahead two-thirds.
All ahead two-thirds, aye.

151
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:41,785
Mr. Emmett, take her down.

152
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:44,746
Make her depth 150 feet,
10 degree down bubble.

153
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,374
150 feet, 10 degree
down bubble. Aye, sir.

154
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,835
Chief of the watch,
sound the dive alarm.
Pass the word along the 1 MC.

155
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,214
Open the main
ballast tank vents.
Aye, sir, passing the word.

156
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:56,007
AII ahead
two thirds, sir.

157
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:57,884
Dive, dive, dive.

158
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:01,971
Sir, main ballast
tank vents indicate open.

159
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,807
Aye. Both planes dive,
15 degrees.

160
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:06,434
Both planes dive,
15 degrees. Aye.

161
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:09,562
All clear!

162
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:13,650
Decks awash.
Decks awash.
Aye, sir.

163
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,348
First time on a submarine?
That's right.

164
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:49,853
60 feet.

165
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,358
Lower the scope.

166
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:01,698
Captain, engine room
reports minor flooding from
shaft seals and brine pump.

167
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:05,034
Bilge is at 18 inches
and rising.
Very well.

168
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,746
How deep
does this thing go?

169
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,791
She'll go
all the way to the bottom
if we don't stop her.

170
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:14,627
Normally we try
not to get below 150 feet.

171
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:17,088
Any deeper,
the leaks overwhelm the pumps.

172
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:21,009
These S-boats are antiques,
older than most of the crew.

173
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:26,890
100 feet.
Aye.

174
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:34,272
Excuse me, Mr. Emmett.

175
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,902
Put a pipe patch on it,
lash it with marline.

176
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:40,528
The yard can fix it
when we get back to port.

177
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:42,280
Aye, sir.

178
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:48,203
Relax, gentlemen.
She's old, but she'll hold.

179
00:23:51,248 --> 00:23:53,291
Last night,
at 0300 hours...

180
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,253
a British destroyer
reported depth-charging
and sinking a German U-boat.

181
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,756
However, some time
thereafter. . .

182
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,135
Allied direction-finding
stations triangulated a coded
enemy radio signal. . .

183
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,430
to this position here,
near the CHOP line.

184
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,558
We believe the U-boat
was disabled, not sunk. . .

185
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:13,478
and is drifting eastward
on a four-knot current.

186
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:16,648
Now, French resistance
reported a resupply
submarine. . .

187
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:20,026
sailed from
the Lorient U-boat pens
yesterday afternoon. . .

188
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,903
with engine parts
and mechanics.

189
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:25,865
And we believe
it's gonna rendezvous
with the disabled U-boat.

190
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:29,285
Onboard that U-boat is this.

191
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:37,460
A typewriter?
An Enigma code machine.

192
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:41,297
It allows the German navy
to communicate with
its submarines in secret.

193
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:45,552
And our inability
to decipher their messages
is costing us this war.

194
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:47,387
Mr. Coonan.

195
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:50,473
All right, this is basically
a Trojan Horse operation.

196
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,353
The S-33 will rendezvous
with the U-boat, posing
as the German resupply sub.

197
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:56,646
I will lead
a boarding party. . .

198
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,357
dressed in
Kriegsmarine uniforms
to the enemy submarine.

199
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:02,485
We will take it by force
and secure the Enigma.

200
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,071
Any German survivors
will be transferred
to the S-33. . .

201
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,447
and the U-boat
will be scuttled.

202
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:09,075
The German resupply
submarine will arrive
at the rendezvous. . .

203
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,537
and will assume that
the U-boat succumbed
to its wounds and sank.

204
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:16,249
The Germans must never
suspect we have the Enigma.
That is vital.

205
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:19,252
- So it's a race?
- Yes, effectively.

206
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,922
Who's the boarding party?
Well, since you're the XO,
you, sir.

207
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:26,134
Mr. Emmett, Mr. Larson,
Mr. Hirsch and nine
of your ship's company.

208
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:29,262
The captain, of course,
will remain onboard the S-33.

209
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:34,225
Mr. Coonan, our boys
are submarine sailors,
not combat Marines.

210
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,186
The boys onboard that U-boat
are sailors too.

211
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:40,857
Your men will be ready,
Lieutenant.
I'll train them myself.

212
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:44,068
You've come to the right boat.

213
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,365
Ahoy! Friends!
Guten Tag.

214
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:15,743
We have many wounded !

215
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:17,453
Take us prisoner, please!

216
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,498
We'll be no trouble.

217
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:23,251
Give us a hand !

218
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:27,213
It's the law of the sea,
my friend.

219
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,267
We need water and food !

220
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:47,066
We just want to get home!

221
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:56,617
We just need
a bit of a hand.

222
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:58,995
We have no--

223
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:28,691
I'm telling you, she
was hotter than Dorothy Lamour
and better built.

224
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:31,986
Really?
Yeah, I could tell
she was interested.

225
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,530
But she was classy,
you know?

226
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:38,534
The type of girl that wants
you to take her to a country
club dance or something.

227
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,412
Yeah, like you've ever seen
the inside of a country club.

228
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:44,123
Hey! Like I'd even want to,
all right?

229
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:48,586
Anyway, I can see
I'm not getting
anywhere with her. . .

230
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,256
so what I do is,
I use my secret weapon.

231
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:55,760
I tell her about the S-26.
Does the trick right away.

232
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:58,805
Man, you don't want
to be talking about that
while we're underway.

233
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:01,808
Why? What happened
with the S-26?
Yeah, what happened?

234
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:03,518
You guys don't know?

235
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:04,936
No.
No.

236
00:29:07,064 --> 00:29:09,982
She was running a test dive
down off Norfolk.

237
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:12,777
Shaft seal failed.

238
00:29:13,695 --> 00:29:15,905
She sunk to 400 feet.

239
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:20,243
Know how much water pressure
there is that deep?

240
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,219
Mazzola, you will be
the first one eating
powdered eggs on this cruise.

241
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:40,096
Keep it up, you hear?

242
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:48,938
Come in.

243
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,406
This is our position, Captain.
We're still bucking
some pretty heavy seas.

244
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,868
I estimate us to be
about three hours
behind schedule.

245
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:04,537
I told Mr. Emmett
to run at flank speed
and hold off on a trim dive. . .

246
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:06,330
until we make up
the lost time.

247
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,374
That's fine, Lieutenant.

248
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,795
You're a first-rate XO,
Andy.

249
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:15,464
A damn good submariner.

250
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,261
I know the men like you.

251
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:23,222
I'd give my life
for any one of them, sir.

252
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:26,559
I know you would.
I'm not questioning
your bravery.

253
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:30,354
The question is
what about their lives?

254
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:35,151
You and Mr. Emmett
are good friends.

255
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,778
Went through
the Academy together.

256
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:41,490
Would you be willing
to sacrifice his life?

257
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,785
Or what about
some of the younger
enlisted men?

258
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,247
I know a lot of those guys
look up to you
like a big brother.

259
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:51,208
You willing to lay
their lives on the line?

260
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:55,463
You see? You hesitate.

261
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:59,008
But as a captain, you can't.

262
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,594
You have to act.

263
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,222
If you don't, you put
the entire crew at risk.

264
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:09,310
Now that's the job.
It's not a science.

265
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:11,812
You have to be able
to make hard decisions. . .

266
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:14,523
based on
imperfect information.

267
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:18,611
Asking men to carry out
orders that may result
in their deaths.

268
00:31:18,695 --> 00:31:22,782
And if you're wrong,
you suffer the consequences.

269
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:27,495
If you're not prepared
to make those decisions. . .

270
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:31,540
without pause,
without reflection. . .

271
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:36,545
then you've got no business
being a submarine captain.

272
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:45,388
Tell Mr. Hirsch
I'd like a word with him,
would you?

273
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:49,684
Aye, sir.

274
00:32:53,832 --> 00:32:56,125
- More soup, Captain?
- Thank you.

275
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:00,504
Wishing I was going
with you, gentlemen.

276
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,174
I feel the same way
you do, Carson.

277
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:06,302
Gentlemen, I'd like
to propose a toast.

278
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:08,846
To the officers and crew
of the S-33. . .

279
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,475
and our distinguished guests,
Mr. Hirsch and Mr. Coonan.

280
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:14,602
Success, gentlemen !

281
00:33:14,686 --> 00:33:16,604
Success.
Success.

282
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:21,734
Captain Dahlgren, sir?
What is it, Wentz?

283
00:33:21,818 --> 00:33:25,279
Chief says we've picked up
a radar contact at 070.

284
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:28,741
Very well. Mr. Larson?

285
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:47,551
Signal lamp
off the starboard bow!

286
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:52,348
I see it.

287
00:33:54,976 --> 00:33:58,604
Pass the word along.
Submarine sighted
off the starboard bow.

288
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:01,148
Stand by to man
battle stations.
Aye, sir.

289
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:05,903
All right, here we go.
One last time.

290
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:08,864
Lieutenant Tyler's raft gets
from the conning tower aft.

291
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,741
My raft gets the gun crew.

292
00:34:10,826 --> 00:34:13,410
And no one, no one shoots
till I shoot first.

293
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:15,704
- You read me?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,374
Outstanding. Lock and load.

295
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,803
It'll be all right, son.
Yes, sir.

296
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:39,145
Captain, I estimate
the German resupply sub has
a 14-knot speed of advance.

297
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:40,980
My latest plot puts them
at 12 hours away, sir.

298
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,439
Very well, Mr. Larson.

299
00:34:42,524 --> 00:34:46,360
Captain, the boarding party's
ready, sir.
Await your go-ahead.

300
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:47,778
I put her low
in the water.

301
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:51,407
I wanna give that U-boat
as little silhouette
as we can.

302
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,077
Sir?
Prepare to disembark
the boarding party.

303
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,620
Aye, Captain.

304
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,168
If this thing
goes south. . .

305
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:04,795
I will blow that Nazi boat
right out of the water.

306
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,423
Understood, sir.
Very well.

307
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:38,913
All set, Captain.

308
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:40,789
Now you listen to me.

309
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,667
You get them their damn trophy
and you get the hell
out of there.

310
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:47,546
Aye, sir.
The boys are gonna be fine.

311
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:50,966
I know they will, sir.

312
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:56,013
Good luck, Andy.

313
00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:59,350
Godspeed, Skipper.

314
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:38,032
Easy, Mr. Hirsch.
We're almost there.

315
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,993
We're gonna bushwhack them
real good.

316
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:50,419
All right,
we got 12 men topside,
three on the bridge. . .

317
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,172
four on the foredeck,
five aft.

318
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:58,052
Now remember, both rafts
need to be tied up
before we move.

319
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:05,225
Jesus H. Christ.
They got machine guns.

320
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,102
Steady, gentlemen.

321
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:09,396
Wait for the signal.

322
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:38,842
Mr. Hirsch.

323
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:43,639
Hello the boat, you asshole.
Shut up.

324
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,276
Goddamn you, Hirsch,
say something.

325
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:23,822
Let's board this thing.
Let's board it.
Board it! Get out of the raft.

326
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:28,911
Conning tower. Move. Move.

327
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:34,708
Clear the conning tower now!

328
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:41,173
Watch yourself,
there. Man in the hole.
Another one there!

329
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,926
- Griggs is hit!
- Get him off!

330
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:53,101
Move, move!
Trigger, round the back. Now!

331
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:57,606
Griggs! Griggs!

332
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,983
We gotta get inside!
Griggs!

333
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:02,694
Chief, Tank,
come down now!

334
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,405
Ready?

335
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,785
All right, open it! Fire!

336
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:14,998
Tyler, let's go!
Inside!

337
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,794
Cover your men ! Go, go!

338
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:26,969
Don't let them
close it.
Don't let them close it!

339
00:41:48,658 --> 00:41:51,159
Two, three, four,
five. Shut it.

340
00:41:52,495 --> 00:41:54,580
Let's go. Go! Get down ! Go!

341
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:57,207
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

342
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,720
Get off, get off!
Don't move, don't move!

343
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:12,139
Get back, get back,
get back!

344
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:14,182
Just drop it! Drop it!

345
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:25,944
Get them outta here!
Get them outta here!

346
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:28,363
You hit?
Yeah, I'm okay.

347
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,245
Stern team, go! Bow team, go!

348
00:42:41,544 --> 00:42:43,670
I'm outta clips, sir.
You go ahead.

349
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:46,840
Rabbit!

350
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:49,176
All right, get them
outta here. Get them
outta here. Let's go!

351
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,179
Get down. Down, down,
down, down ! Get down !

352
00:42:52,263 --> 00:42:55,057
All right, who's the captain?
Huh? Who's the captain?

353
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:57,976
Kapitän?
How about you, ugly?
Are you the captain?

354
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:00,437
Trigger, if anybody moves. . .

355
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:02,606
you shoot them right here
in the forehead,
you understand me?

356
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,066
Yes, sir!
All right.

357
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:24,961
Hirsch, we got it.

358
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,069
Speaking in German]
Get down, down !

359
00:44:31,154 --> 00:44:33,238
Down there!

360
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,615
Down, down !

361
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,578
Rabbit, check the bilge
for a scuttling charge.
Give me your weapon !

362
00:44:39,662 --> 00:44:41,747
- Move, sailor, move!
- Aye, sir!

363
00:44:44,834 --> 00:44:46,752
Goddamn it, stay there.

364
00:44:49,672 --> 00:44:51,757
Hirsch, I think we got
the code books!

365
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:53,592
Andy, that ink's running.
Dry it.

366
00:44:53,676 --> 00:44:54,760
Okay.

367
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:59,014
It's water soluble.
Yeah, use the blankets,
use the blankets.

368
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:04,394
Nothing but pipes and valves,
Mr. Emmett.

369
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,188
Bow compartment secure.

370
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:31,713
Bunch of Marys.

371
00:45:35,593 --> 00:45:38,720
How you doing?
You're number 10.
There you go.

372
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,308
You having a good night?
Uh-huh.

373
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:45,977
You ain't gonna be
none too happy
y'all lost this boat.

374
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:48,230
Lucky number 11, let's go!

375
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:52,651
It's your first time
looking at a black man,
ain't it?

376
00:45:52,735 --> 00:45:54,277
Get used to it.

377
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:57,072
Let's go! Get over here!

378
00:46:31,482 --> 00:46:32,774
All right,
hurry it up.

379
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:35,110
It's gonna be sunup
in an hour.

380
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:15,817
Fuse is burning, sir.

381
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:19,029
All right,
she's burning ! Let's go!
Let's get this raft loaded !

382
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:20,572
Let's move!

383
00:47:21,866 --> 00:47:24,910
Sir, we got
all the prisoners transferred
to the S-33.

384
00:47:24,994 --> 00:47:26,328
Very well.

385
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,587
Hey, Andy.

386
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,506
Make sure
you got everything !
Get in the raft!

387
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:41,176
Get everything
below decks. Let's go!

388
00:48:23,302 --> 00:48:26,012
Everybody, below decks!
Get down !

389
00:48:26,097 --> 00:48:27,973
Chief, take her down !
Aye, sir!

390
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,725
The scuttling charge!
Let's go, Hirsch !
The Enigma!

391
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:38,900
Trigger! Grab hold !

392
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,323
Trigger! Attaboy!

393
00:48:51,122 --> 00:48:52,539
I've got it!

394
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:55,834
Help me! Help me! Oh, no! No!

395
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:05,510
We gotta get
outta here!

396
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:07,387
There's still men
in the water.

397
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:09,973
Let's go!
Chief, there's still men
in the water.

398
00:49:10,057 --> 00:49:11,516
Go!

399
00:49:17,982 --> 00:49:19,399
Andy!

400
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:22,610
Andy! Go!

401
00:49:25,114 --> 00:49:26,322
Dive!

402
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:29,075
Dive!

403
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:31,953
Take her down !

404
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:34,914
Tyler.

405
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,000
Dive!

406
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:42,107
Chief, you find those vents?
Everything's in German !

407
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:43,983
Rabbit,
get to the torpedo room.
Sir.

408
00:50:44,068 --> 00:50:47,821
Where's the goddamn 1 MC?
Trigger, get on the helm !
Mazzola, take the planes.

409
00:50:47,947 --> 00:50:49,948
Aye, sir.
Wentz,
what about these?

410
00:50:50,032 --> 00:50:52,283
I don't know. I don't know.
There's no label !

411
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:55,328
Okay, those are
the aft ballast tank vents!

412
00:50:55,412 --> 00:50:58,581
These are the mid-ship vents
and these are
the main induction valves.

413
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:01,626
Make sure they're shut.
Tank, Tank, I need speed !

414
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,961
Get the screws turning.

415
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:04,087
The lights are on. . .

416
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:06,131
so there's got to be
some power left
in those ballasts.

417
00:51:06,215 --> 00:51:07,340
I can't read this!

418
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:09,425
Rabbit,
find out how many fish
we've got in the tubes. . .

419
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,678
and figure out
how to launch them ! Go!

420
00:51:11,846 --> 00:51:13,388
I can't read this!

421
00:51:13,556 --> 00:51:18,143
Go help Tank, Hirsch.
Go, Hirsch !
Find the Christmas tree.

422
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:21,396
We've gotta make sure
we don't have any holes
in the boat!

423
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,648
Klar, klar, klar. Wentz,
what the hell is kIar?

424
00:51:24,525 --> 00:51:27,068
KIar means clear.
KIar means clear.
All compartments secure.

425
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:28,987
White for green?
White for green.

426
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:31,072
- No holes in the ship!
- Dive the boat!

427
00:51:31,574 --> 00:51:34,576
Opening ballast vents!
Opening mid-ship valves!

428
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:36,911
Opening mid-ship vents!

429
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:50,633
This is forward trim,
aft trim.
These are auxiliaries.

430
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:53,428
Main motor.
Auxiliary, auxiliary.

431
00:52:08,652 --> 00:52:11,029
This is in meters.
Everything's in meters.

432
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:12,822
Passing 15 meters.

433
00:52:12,907 --> 00:52:14,782
Recommend shutting main vents!

434
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:17,744
Make it so! Wentz,
get in the sound room.
See what's out there.

435
00:52:17,828 --> 00:52:18,995
Yes, sir!

436
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:21,039
Make depth 20 meters.
Depth 20 meters, aye.

437
00:52:21,123 --> 00:52:24,584
Chief, take the dive!
I have the dive.

438
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:29,214
At 20 meters. Bow planes
at zero. Control your depth
with the stern planes.

439
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:32,133
Bow planes at zero.
Controlling depth
with the stern planes.

440
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:34,969
Oh, shit.
All ahead full, sir!

441
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:37,180
Batteries are flat
and draining fast!

442
00:52:37,264 --> 00:52:40,934
Mr. Tyler, I hear
the S-33 breaking up. Wait.

443
00:52:41,393 --> 00:52:44,771
I hold a submerged U-boat,
010.

444
00:52:44,855 --> 00:52:47,065
Real close.
Less than 1,000 yards.

445
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:49,275
Goddamn resupply sub.
Trigger, what's our heading?

446
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,568
280, sir.

447
00:52:50,653 --> 00:52:53,571
Aye, right full rudder!
Steady on 010.

448
00:52:53,656 --> 00:52:56,950
Aye, sir! Right full rudder.
Steady on course 010, sir.

449
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:59,744
Tank, starboard back full.
Rabbit, get back to me.

450
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:01,788
Starboard back full. Aye, sir.

451
00:53:07,044 --> 00:53:10,171
Watch your depth.
She'll squat.
Rabbit!

452
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:13,758
We got four fish.
Tubes are flooded.

453
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:15,843
But I can't open
the muzzle doors
until I equalize.

454
00:53:15,928 --> 00:53:18,137
I can't find the valve!
Wentz, help Rabbit!

455
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:21,849
Enemy submarine close aboard.
Torpedo in the water.
Torpedo in the water!

456
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:24,435
All right, belay that.
Wentz, stay where you are!

457
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,813
Hirsch, hotfoot it
to the torpedo room !

458
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,776
Helm, mark your head
every 10 degrees.
Aye, sir.

459
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,613
Now passing 320.
Turn, baby, turn. Turn !

460
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:42,412
Equalizing valves. Holy shit!
What's what? This is crazy.
I can't equalize the tubes!

461
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:45,540
What do you need?
Equalizing valves!

462
00:53:45,624 --> 00:53:47,125
Valves?
Equalizing valves!

463
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:48,876
Gyro?
No.

464
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:50,795
Drainage.
Some kind of drainage.
No.

465
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:53,715
Now passing 000.

466
00:53:54,049 --> 00:53:56,676
Swing, you bastard, swing.

467
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,221
Chief, stand by in case
we have to flood forward trim.

468
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:06,519
Impulse?
No.

469
00:54:06,603 --> 00:54:08,062
Differential.
Pressure differential?

470
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:10,857
These! Turn them !
This! Turn them !
Which way?

471
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:22,660
Torpedo missed.
It's in our baffles.

472
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:27,874
Two more torpedoes
in the water!

473
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:31,878
Best bearing
to the U-boat, 010.

474
00:54:32,129 --> 00:54:34,464
Aye, Rabbit,
get ready to fire a spread.

475
00:54:34,548 --> 00:54:37,508
Tubes one and two.
Zero gyro. Fire!

476
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,218
Rabbit, fire!

477
00:54:43,474 --> 00:54:45,141
What's going on?
What is that?

478
00:54:45,225 --> 00:54:46,434
Wrong one! Wrong one!

479
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,145
The fish is stuck!
I must've missed
an interlock or something.

480
00:54:49,229 --> 00:54:51,939
Rabbit, get those fish out
before they blow!

481
00:54:52,024 --> 00:54:53,941
Look for "impulse air"
or "firing air."

482
00:54:54,068 --> 00:54:56,277
That was "impulse" there
and there!

483
00:55:00,783 --> 00:55:03,368
One, two, away.
Lining up tubes three
and four.

484
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:06,287
Three and four, fire!

485
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,463
All fish running hot,
straight and normal.

486
00:55:45,577 --> 00:55:47,328
I think they all missed, sir.

487
00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:02,009
Shit.

488
00:56:07,558 --> 00:56:09,434
U-boat's breaking up!

489
00:56:10,602 --> 00:56:12,478
I hear bulkheads collapsing.

490
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,860
The 33 boat, Mr. Tyler.

491
00:56:25,868 --> 00:56:28,411
Let's take her up
and look for survivors, Chief.

492
00:56:28,537 --> 00:56:31,122
Give me some rise
on the planes!
Rise on the planes, aye.

493
00:56:31,248 --> 00:56:32,707
Deploy main ballast!

494
00:56:55,397 --> 00:56:56,731
Gotcha.

495
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:19,295
Oh, crap.

496
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:28,429
Help!

497
00:57:29,932 --> 00:57:38,105
Help!

498
00:58:13,225 --> 00:58:14,725
Do you speak English?

499
00:58:16,186 --> 00:58:18,354
English.
Do you speak English?

500
00:58:18,564 --> 00:58:20,648
What's your rank?

501
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:24,402
What do you do?

502
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,654
What's your job? Your job.

503
00:58:27,072 --> 00:58:28,281
Job.

504
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:38,165
You're an electrician. Good.

505
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,127
You can help us
squeeze some more juice
out of them batteries.

506
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:45,339
Sir, I see the skipper.

507
00:59:00,439 --> 00:59:01,897
Battery's dead.

508
00:59:02,357 --> 00:59:05,026
Whatever juice was left
we used up when we maneuvered.

509
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:07,903
- What about the diesels?
- Starboard's a wreck.

510
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,864
We need to dry dock
to fix it.

511
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:13,451
Portside diesel's the good
news. Whoever the Krauts
had wrenching on it. . .

512
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,454
didn't know a piston head
from his sister's titty.

513
00:59:16,538 --> 00:59:17,872
I think I can fix it.

514
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:21,334
Okay, Tank.
Do what you can.

515
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,127
Yes, sir.

516
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,839
All right. Listen up.

517
00:59:27,507 --> 00:59:29,550
We've decided on a course.

518
00:59:30,218 --> 00:59:32,595
We're heading for England,
Land's End.

519
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:35,723
It's the closest,
besides occupied France.

520
00:59:37,142 --> 00:59:39,310
Rabbit,
how many torpedoes do we have?

521
00:59:39,394 --> 00:59:42,146
Just one.
It's in the stern tube,
which is busted.

522
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,482
The high pressure
line's bleeding air
from somewhere.

523
00:59:44,566 --> 00:59:46,817
Sir?
Yeah, what is it, Trigger?

524
00:59:46,943 --> 00:59:48,527
Can't we just use the radio?

525
00:59:49,404 --> 00:59:51,614
Fire off a mayday
and wait for a rescue?

526
00:59:51,948 --> 00:59:53,658
That's impossible.

527
00:59:53,742 --> 00:59:56,994
If we transmit, the Germans
will direction-find
our position to a grid. . .

528
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:58,788
where they're missing
two U-boats.

529
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:03,250
If they even suspect we have
the Enigma, they will change
their entire coding system.

530
01:00:03,335 --> 01:00:06,253
And that would
completely negate
the purpose of our mission.

531
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:07,755
Mr. Tyler. . .

532
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:10,132
if we head for England. . .

533
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:13,052
we're gonna go
straight through
the western approaches.

534
01:00:13,512 --> 01:00:17,181
He's right. I mean,
that's Jerry's backyard.

535
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:18,683
Listen, guys.

536
01:00:18,767 --> 01:00:19,892
It's full of U-boats.

537
01:00:19,976 --> 01:00:22,269
And we've got nothing
to defend ourselves with.

538
01:00:22,354 --> 01:00:24,522
Do you think
I got all the answers here?

539
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:28,776
You think I know how we're
gonna get out of this mess?
I don't. I don't know how.

540
01:00:29,986 --> 01:00:32,530
I say we use the radio.
Nobody asked you.

541
01:00:32,614 --> 01:00:34,782
We use the radio
and take our goddamn chances.

542
01:00:34,866 --> 01:00:36,033
Yeah.
I said, can it.

543
01:00:36,118 --> 01:00:38,994
It's what the captain
would have done--
Captain's dead.

544
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:00,326
This is crazy.

545
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:02,953
This whole thing is crazy.

546
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:05,706
Risking our lives
over a typewriter.

547
01:02:05,957 --> 01:02:07,792
It's not
a typewriter.

548
01:02:07,876 --> 01:02:10,127
The hell it ain't.
It's got buttons
like a typewriter.

549
01:02:10,212 --> 01:02:11,462
Yeah, well, it's not.

550
01:02:11,546 --> 01:02:15,090
Yeah, well, whatever
it is, I say it's crazy we
get ourselves killed over it.

551
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:17,426
The Navy says
it's important,
it's important.

552
01:02:18,678 --> 01:02:21,472
The Navy says
it's more important
than you, him, me, fine.

553
01:02:21,556 --> 01:02:23,224
We're gonna die trying.

554
01:02:24,476 --> 01:02:27,520
And that ain't crazy.
That's our job.

555
01:02:29,147 --> 01:02:31,398
Well, what I don't
seem to understand, Chief. . .

556
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:33,400
is how come
you're not in charge?

557
01:02:33,485 --> 01:02:36,946
Scuttlebutt is Dahlgren was
kicking Tyler out of the Navy
anyway, and everybody--

558
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,534
You stow that shit
right now, sailor.

559
01:02:41,618 --> 01:02:43,244
Lieutenant Tyler is
your commanding officer. . .

560
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:45,955
and you will respect
that man as such.

561
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:49,500
Do you understand?
Yes, Chief.

562
01:03:37,382 --> 01:03:39,258
Look at them sons of bitches.

563
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:43,429
You know my pop
was a fisherman?

564
01:03:44,556 --> 01:03:48,559
He had this old 60-footer
he'd run all over the Gulf.

565
01:03:48,643 --> 01:03:50,603
Noisy two-stroke diesel.

566
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,189
Rotten to the gunnels,
that thing.

567
01:03:54,399 --> 01:03:58,193
I could scrub that deck
three times a day,
and it still stunk like fish.

568
01:04:00,363 --> 01:04:03,657
And I swore I'd never
skipper a boat like that,
Chief.

569
01:04:06,995 --> 01:04:08,245
I saw myself. . .

570
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:10,915
standing on the bridge
of a battleship.

571
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,710
A real sea captain.

572
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:18,839
Mr. Tyler,
permission to speak freely?

573
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:21,216
Of course, Chief.

574
01:04:21,843 --> 01:04:23,344
This is the Navy. . .

575
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:28,182
where a commanding officer
is a mighty
and terrible thing.

576
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:30,476
A man to be feared
and respected.

577
01:04:30,685 --> 01:04:33,187
All knowing, all powerful.

578
01:04:33,688 --> 01:04:37,775
Don't you dare say
what you said to the boys back
there again, "I don't know."

579
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:41,111
Those three words
will kill a crew,
dead as a depth charge.

580
01:04:43,031 --> 01:04:44,907
You're the skipper now.

581
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:48,035
And the skipper
always knows what to do,
whether he does or not.

582
01:04:53,249 --> 01:04:56,085
Aircraft
off the port bow!
Shit!

583
01:05:06,388 --> 01:05:09,181
Real sorry, sir.
It dropped right out
of the clouds.

584
01:05:09,766 --> 01:05:11,976
Rabbit, Trigger,
stand by the flak gun.

585
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,352
Sir.
Sir.

586
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:17,856
It's German. Looks like
long-range reconnaissance.

587
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:21,276
What the hell's
it doing way out here?

588
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:29,368
Jesus, here it comes.
All right. Sit tight.

589
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:33,330
As far as he knows, we're all
playing on the same team.
Everybody wave.

590
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,416
Wave?

591
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:39,169
Sir, we're sitting ducks.
If we shoot first, we can
blow them out of the sky.

592
01:05:39,254 --> 01:05:41,755
We shoot and miss,
he's gonna radio us in.

593
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,341
That plane's gonna be the
least of our problems.

594
01:05:44,426 --> 01:05:46,635
This is crazy.
You're gonna get us killed.

595
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:57,646
He's coming around.

596
01:05:57,897 --> 01:05:59,231
He's coming around !

597
01:06:04,446 --> 01:06:06,530
He's attacking !
For Christ's sake, Rabbit,
do something !

598
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:09,074
Mazzola, shut up.
Rabbit, ignore him.
Do something !

599
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:11,160
He's gonna strafe us, Rabbit!
He's coming right at us!

600
01:06:11,244 --> 01:06:12,327
It's lined up! Do something !

601
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:15,164
Acknowledge me, Seaman Parker.
What are you
waiting for?

602
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,458
Yeah, Rabbit! Shoot him !
Seamen Parker,
I'm ordering you !

603
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:20,085
Do not fire that weapon !
Get your finger off
that trigger!

604
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,129
Pull the trigger!
Pull the trigger!

605
01:06:22,464 --> 01:06:24,965
We're gonna die!
Do it! Do it!

606
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:27,593
Come on ! Goddamn it,
can't you see him?

607
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:36,977
What the hell
are you doing, huh?

608
01:06:37,062 --> 01:06:39,313
This is not
a goddamn democracy!

609
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:43,942
Mr. Tyler,
I see a mast on the horizon !

610
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,075
Shit!
That's a Nazi destroyer.

611
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,953
That plane
must have been running
a recon screen for it.

612
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:59,917
Clear the bridge!
Chief, secure the diesel
and dive the ship!

613
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:01,543
Dive the ship!
Aye, sir!

614
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,519
We don't have
a green board, sir.
What's wrong?

615
01:08:00,603 --> 01:08:01,603
The engine room's not ready.

616
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:02,855
No power
on the starboard engine.

617
01:08:02,939 --> 01:08:04,606
Vents won't open.
We lost hydraulics.

618
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:08,068
Tank, secure the diesel
and rig the engine room
for dive!

619
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:11,071
Tank, acknowledge!

620
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:15,701
Goddamn it! Mazzola, go see
what the hell's going on
back there.

621
01:09:25,188 --> 01:09:27,773
Drop it, you Nazi
son of a bitch ! Drop it!

622
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:39,034
Goddamn it.

623
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:42,579
I'm real sorry,
Mr. Tyler.

624
01:09:42,997 --> 01:09:44,831
Took me right off my feet.

625
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:48,543
Listen to me.
You've got to
secure the diesel.

626
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:51,213
And find out
why the vent valves
won't open. Now!

627
01:09:51,297 --> 01:09:53,799
Yes, sir.
Goddamn it!

628
01:09:53,883 --> 01:09:57,261
Eddie, get this son of a bitch
out of here. Chain him up
to the bunks.

629
01:09:57,345 --> 01:10:00,847
Make sure his hands
and feet are secure.
Put him into submission !

630
01:10:01,015 --> 01:10:04,434
Lieutenant, we have
a big problem!
Take care of it, Eddie.

631
01:10:12,819 --> 01:10:14,403
Oh, shit.

632
01:10:23,037 --> 01:10:26,206
Tell Tank to finish
those repairs. The destroyer
is sending a launch.

633
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:28,333
He needs five minutes,
Mr. Tyler!

634
01:10:28,418 --> 01:10:30,544
We don't have
five minutes, Chief.

635
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:34,131
Lieutenant, the deck cannon.
If we fire a shell
below the water line. . . .

636
01:10:34,215 --> 01:10:38,677
It wouldn't do
a goddamn thing. No, that tub
could take a hundred shells.

637
01:10:39,053 --> 01:10:42,055
What we need
is a working torpedo,
which we do not have.

638
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,641
Trigger, stand by
on the flak gun, and when
I give you the word. . .

639
01:10:44,726 --> 01:10:46,143
turn that launch
into driftwood. All right?

640
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:47,352
Yes, sir.

641
01:10:48,062 --> 01:10:50,397
Gonna find out who we are
in about 60 seconds.

642
01:10:55,236 --> 01:10:57,195
Trigger,
ready on that weapon?

643
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,239
Chief, tell Tank
he has one minute. . .

644
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:02,075
and get Wentz and Rabbit
up here with the machine gun.

645
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:06,246
Hirsch, what'll happen
when they find out
we're not German?

646
01:11:06,331 --> 01:11:09,916
After they shoot us as spies,
they'll radio
into headquarters.

647
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:12,377
They'll tell them
the Enigma's been
compromised.

648
01:11:14,172 --> 01:11:18,091
What if we take out
their radio, before they can
notify anyone about us?

649
01:11:18,176 --> 01:11:21,094
How?
With that deck gun.

650
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,264
It's gonna be
one hell of a shot,
but we can do it.

651
01:11:24,515 --> 01:11:27,351
Then we dive like hell,
and we get under them quick.

652
01:11:27,935 --> 01:11:31,855
We lure them a little bit
closer to the continent,
in range of Allied air cover.

653
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:34,816
Then we call in
an air strike.
Mr. Tyler.

654
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:36,777
Yeah, we call in
an air strike.

655
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,405
Son of a bitch cut off
pressure to the hydraulics.

656
01:11:40,573 --> 01:11:42,407
We need to find
the stop valve.

657
01:11:48,998 --> 01:11:50,207
Damn !

658
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:55,337
See that structure
topside just aft
of the flying bridge. . .

659
01:11:55,421 --> 01:11:56,880
with the big antenna
sticking out of it?

660
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,799
Yes, sir.
That's the radio shack.

661
01:11:58,883 --> 01:12:00,217
You and Wentz
get on the deck gun.

662
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:04,054
On my command, I want you
to put a shell right through
the goddamn porthole.

663
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:08,058
Get to it, gentlemen.
Get to it.

664
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:09,476
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

665
01:12:28,496 --> 01:12:31,081
Tell them to go away,
Mr. Hirsch.

666
01:12:42,427 --> 01:12:43,844
Talk to me, Rabbit!

667
01:12:43,928 --> 01:12:46,012
Deck gun manned
and ready in all respects,
sir.

668
01:12:46,097 --> 01:12:47,264
Fire.

669
01:13:04,115 --> 01:13:05,365
Clear the deck.

670
01:13:33,019 --> 01:13:35,061
Dive! Dive! Dive!

671
01:13:48,367 --> 01:13:49,910
Come on.
Why aren't we diving?

672
01:13:49,994 --> 01:13:51,703
Repairs aren't complete, sir.

673
01:13:52,038 --> 01:13:53,413
- Eddie, man the planes.
- Aye, sir!

674
01:13:53,498 --> 01:13:56,166
Tank, all ahead full.
Aye, sir! Manning the planes!

675
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,751
All ahead full, aye!

676
01:13:58,586 --> 01:14:01,505
Nice shot, Rabbit.
That radio's history.

677
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:14,476
We're heading
right towards them.
That's right.

678
01:14:14,936 --> 01:14:17,812
Her deck guns can't get to us,
if we're in close enough.

679
01:14:17,897 --> 01:14:20,690
Let's hope we can dive
and clear her keel.

680
01:14:34,497 --> 01:14:35,872
That's it.

681
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:38,124
Hydraulics restored.

682
01:14:38,209 --> 01:14:40,961
Thank you, Tank.
That did it.
We're going under.

683
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:53,431
Passing five meters.

684
01:15:02,817 --> 01:15:04,442
Passing 10 meters.

685
01:15:11,242 --> 01:15:12,826
15 meters.

686
01:15:41,689 --> 01:15:42,939
20 meters.

687
01:16:19,143 --> 01:16:20,894
Trigger,
left full rudder.

688
01:16:25,066 --> 01:16:26,858
Tank, all ahead two-thirds.

689
01:16:36,744 --> 01:16:38,203
Contact maneuvering.

690
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:43,750
Heavy cavitation.

691
01:16:45,795 --> 01:16:47,087
Splashes.

692
01:18:01,537 --> 01:18:03,997
Step away from that bulkhead,
Mr. Hirsch.

693
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:09,878
The shock wave from
one of these explosions
can snap your spine.

694
01:18:14,842 --> 01:18:16,468
Chief. . .

695
01:18:17,553 --> 01:18:19,387
you ever been depth charged?

696
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,680
Once. . .

697
01:18:21,682 --> 01:18:23,016
off Murmansk. . .

698
01:18:23,642 --> 01:18:25,143
back in World War I.

699
01:18:26,312 --> 01:18:30,356
One charge came so close,
it rattled four teeth out
of the skipper's head.

700
01:18:41,994 --> 01:18:43,369
Wasn't even close.

701
01:18:51,212 --> 01:18:54,380
Control, the starboard
e-motor's seized up.

702
01:18:54,673 --> 01:18:56,508
The German must have
sabotaged it.

703
01:18:56,592 --> 01:18:57,967
Goddamn it.

704
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:05,892
There's no way we make it
to Allied air cover
creeping along on one shaft.

705
01:21:02,509 --> 01:21:04,844
Eddie, help Chief.

706
01:21:07,389 --> 01:21:08,640
Yes, sir.

707
01:21:16,065 --> 01:21:17,941
Mr. Chief, I got that.

708
01:21:20,653 --> 01:21:24,197
Tank, you alive back there?

709
01:21:25,991 --> 01:21:27,241
Yes, sir.

710
01:21:27,493 --> 01:21:28,785
Good.

711
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:32,205
Port ahead two-thirds.

712
01:21:33,707 --> 01:21:36,292
Port ahead two-thirds.
Aye, sir.

713
01:22:02,403 --> 01:22:03,611
Tank. . .

714
01:22:04,321 --> 01:22:06,114
can you fix the stern tube?

715
01:22:07,908 --> 01:22:09,617
I don't know, Mr. Tyler.

716
01:22:10,244 --> 01:22:12,245
I don't want
an "I don't know."

717
01:22:13,372 --> 01:22:17,125
Can you fix
the torpedo tube? Yes or no?

718
01:22:20,045 --> 01:22:21,879
Yes, sir. I think I can.

719
01:22:22,881 --> 01:22:24,132
Thank you, Tank.

720
01:22:24,216 --> 01:22:25,425
Chief. . .

721
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:27,927
make depth 160 meters.

722
01:22:32,224 --> 01:22:34,392
That's more than 500 feet.

723
01:22:37,062 --> 01:22:38,813
Take us down, Chief.

724
01:22:41,775 --> 01:22:43,067
Aye, sir.

725
01:22:44,111 --> 01:22:45,862
160 meters.

726
01:22:46,155 --> 01:22:47,989
20 degrees dive,
both planes.

727
01:22:48,073 --> 01:22:51,117
20 degrees dive,
aye, sir.
20 degrees dive, aye, sir.

728
01:22:51,201 --> 01:22:53,161
Mr. Tyler, sir. . .

729
01:22:54,038 --> 01:22:56,706
you planning on
going up against
a destroyer with. . .

730
01:22:56,790 --> 01:23:00,043
only one fish in the tube
and a busted motor?

731
01:23:00,377 --> 01:23:01,836
Yes, I am, Eddie.

732
01:23:02,212 --> 01:23:05,131
How wise is that, Lieutenant?
Not very.

733
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:07,300
But have a look. Chief.

734
01:23:09,303 --> 01:23:12,638
There is no way
a two-knot submarine,
can get in firing position. . .

735
01:23:12,723 --> 01:23:16,642
against a 30-knot destroyer,
unless we go deep.

736
01:23:17,311 --> 01:23:18,728
At 160 meters. . .

737
01:23:18,812 --> 01:23:21,773
we can shoot out
a bunch of junk
from the forward tubes.

738
01:23:21,857 --> 01:23:24,442
It will resurface
and create a debris field.

739
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:27,236
Now the destroyer's gonna go
to the center
of that debris field. . .

740
01:23:27,321 --> 01:23:29,864
shut off its engines
to make it real nice
and quiet. . .

741
01:23:29,948 --> 01:23:32,742
and do an acoustic search,
to make sure we're dead.

742
01:23:32,826 --> 01:23:35,244
But we're not.
See, we're here. . .

743
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:38,623
on our way
up to periscope depth.

744
01:23:39,124 --> 01:23:41,250
All right,
principle of ascent velocity.

745
01:23:41,335 --> 01:23:44,754
We let our positive buoyancy
pull us up,
and away from the destroyer.

746
01:23:44,838 --> 01:23:48,257
And when we surface,
we'll be showing it
our ass at 700 yards.

747
01:23:48,634 --> 01:23:52,595
That is a perfect setup
for a stern shot
on a stationary target.

748
01:23:52,763 --> 01:23:53,763
Boom.

749
01:23:54,598 --> 01:23:56,849
It don't get
much prettier than that.

750
01:23:58,977 --> 01:24:00,520
All right, Mr. Tyler.

751
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:02,313
All right.

752
01:24:02,689 --> 01:24:04,232
Passing 130 meters.

753
01:24:04,316 --> 01:24:05,650
Very well.

754
01:24:05,776 --> 01:24:09,779
Rabbit, I need you
to load Mazzola's body
into tube three. . .

755
01:24:09,863 --> 01:24:13,032
and put an escape jacket
onto him
to make sure he floats.

756
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:16,285
Gonna shoot him out
like garbage?

757
01:24:24,044 --> 01:24:26,379
His body is gonna save
our lives.

758
01:24:28,006 --> 01:24:29,882
I'll say a few words
for him.

759
01:24:30,342 --> 01:24:32,009
Hirsch, go with Rabbit.

760
01:24:32,302 --> 01:24:34,804
Eddie, can you man
both planes?
Yes, sir.

761
01:24:35,389 --> 01:24:36,722
Mr. Tyler.
Yeah.

762
01:24:37,558 --> 01:24:39,934
If you can't take out
that destroyer. . .

763
01:24:40,018 --> 01:24:42,520
the danger is not that
some of us may die. . .

764
01:24:42,688 --> 01:24:44,605
but that some of us
may live.

765
01:24:47,985 --> 01:24:50,570
These men have seen
and heard things. . .

766
01:24:51,029 --> 01:24:53,489
that must not be revealed
to the enemy.

767
01:24:54,408 --> 01:24:55,700
Our secrets. . .

768
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:58,578
such as our
radar capabilities. . .

769
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:01,581
and our understanding
of German encryption.

770
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:07,003
If we fall into German hands
alive, we will be tortured
without mercy.

771
01:25:07,629 --> 01:25:10,047
Either you succeed
in sinking that ship. . .

772
01:25:11,091 --> 01:25:14,385
or you must see to it
that none of us survive. . .

773
01:25:14,761 --> 01:25:16,095
to be captured.

774
01:25:48,921 --> 01:25:50,880
We commend his soul
to God. . .

775
01:25:52,174 --> 01:25:54,217
and commit his body
to the deep.

776
01:26:02,184 --> 01:26:05,019
Mr. Tyler,
contact is zigging.

777
01:26:08,815 --> 01:26:10,066
Splashes.

778
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:13,861
Contact getting closer.

779
01:26:15,155 --> 01:26:16,489
More splashes.

780
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,418
Tank. . .

781
01:26:30,003 --> 01:26:32,713
line out to pump engine
room bilge to sea.

782
01:26:33,006 --> 01:26:34,298
Yes, sir.

783
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:50,314
Rabbit. . .

784
01:26:52,859 --> 01:26:54,360
fire the tubes.

785
01:26:56,238 --> 01:26:57,697
Bye, Mazzola.

786
01:28:13,565 --> 01:28:15,524
They setting them charges
too shallow.

787
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,315
Secure that air valve.

788
01:29:52,706 --> 01:29:54,248
Chief. . .

789
01:29:54,332 --> 01:29:55,708
what's our depth?

790
01:29:57,169 --> 01:29:59,170
160 meters.

791
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:02,298
Zero the planes.

792
01:30:02,382 --> 01:30:04,049
Zero the planes.
Zero the planes.

793
01:30:04,301 --> 01:30:05,551
Splashes!

794
01:30:08,638 --> 01:30:10,431
They're too close together!

795
01:30:11,224 --> 01:30:13,225
I can't count them.

796
01:30:22,277 --> 01:30:23,527
Chief. . .

797
01:30:25,822 --> 01:30:27,823
take us to 200 meters.

798
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:32,661
We're gonna get under
these damn things.

799
01:30:36,124 --> 01:30:37,374
Chief. . .

800
01:30:38,293 --> 01:30:40,419
take us to 200 meters.

801
01:30:47,636 --> 01:30:48,928
Aye, sir.

802
01:30:55,185 --> 01:30:57,603
Making my depth 200 meters.

803
01:30:58,104 --> 01:31:00,272
10 degrees dive, both planes.

804
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,775
10 degrees dive,
both planes.
10 degrees dive. Aye.

805
01:31:25,882 --> 01:31:27,758
170 meters.

806
01:31:40,772 --> 01:31:41,981
Tank. . .

807
01:31:42,357 --> 01:31:44,900
what's the status
on the stern torpedo tube?

808
01:31:46,611 --> 01:31:50,114
There's a couple things wrong.
I can operate the muzzle door
now. . .

809
01:31:50,198 --> 01:31:52,283
but I'm still working
on the impulse air.

810
01:31:52,367 --> 01:31:54,118
180 meters.

811
01:31:57,038 --> 01:32:00,207
Mr. Tyler,
depth gauge back here
says 180 meters.

812
01:32:01,334 --> 01:32:03,711
Thanks, Tank. I know.

813
01:32:05,463 --> 01:32:06,922
Keep working.

814
01:32:19,311 --> 01:32:21,186
190 meters.

815
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:43,542
200 meters.

816
01:32:45,045 --> 01:32:46,462
Zero the planes.

817
01:32:46,546 --> 01:32:48,881
Zero the planes, aye.
Zero the planes.

818
01:33:51,778 --> 01:33:53,779
Mary, mother of God.

819
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:01,620
Those Krauts sure know
how to build a boat.

820
01:34:10,672 --> 01:34:12,089
Chief, take us up!

821
01:34:12,215 --> 01:34:16,260
Blowing negative!
Planes full rise!
Clockwise, Hirsch ! Clockwise!

822
01:34:18,805 --> 01:34:20,305
- All right!
- Hurry up!

823
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:23,225
Go! Go!
Move it, move it!

824
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,479
Chief, are you seeing this?

825
01:34:34,446 --> 01:34:38,615
Needle's off the scale.
We have to blow
main ballast tanks.

826
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:39,950
Do it, Chief!

827
01:34:58,052 --> 01:34:59,678
She's still going down !

828
01:35:00,054 --> 01:35:02,181
Ballast tanks are bone dry.

829
01:35:02,265 --> 01:35:04,141
I'm gonna try the trim tanks.

830
01:35:11,191 --> 01:35:12,524
Come on, come on !

831
01:35:24,579 --> 01:35:26,580
She's going up.
She's going up.

832
01:35:43,348 --> 01:35:45,557
Mr. Tyler, we're coming up.

833
01:35:46,017 --> 01:35:48,477
But I've lost control
over the ballast tanks.

834
01:35:48,561 --> 01:35:50,270
I can't stop our ascent.

835
01:35:51,606 --> 01:35:53,440
Where are we
with the stern torpedo?

836
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:54,900
Piping's damaged.

837
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:58,862
There's a break in the air
line, so there's no pressure
to launch the torpedo.

838
01:35:58,947 --> 01:36:02,658
I tried to bypass the leak,
but it's way back
in the bilge underwater.

839
01:36:02,742 --> 01:36:05,494
There's no way
to reach it. I can't fit.

840
01:36:05,745 --> 01:36:08,330
Think somebody else
could do it?
I don't know.

841
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:11,291
Maybe somebody smaller.

842
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:14,211
That's Rabbit or Trigger.

843
01:36:14,295 --> 01:36:16,588
Coming up on 200 meters.

844
01:36:17,465 --> 01:36:18,924
You gotta pick one.

845
01:36:27,058 --> 01:36:28,100
Trigger.

846
01:36:28,685 --> 01:36:29,935
Trigger. . .

847
01:36:30,603 --> 01:36:31,979
lay aft with Tank.

848
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,107
Move it, son.

849
01:36:36,276 --> 01:36:37,776
You got a job to do.

850
01:36:46,703 --> 01:36:49,454
See here,
we got no air pressure
to fire the torpedo.

851
01:36:50,123 --> 01:36:52,249
One of these pipes is busted
and it's leaking air.

852
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:54,543
How am I gonna find it?
You'll see bubbles
coming out.

853
01:36:54,627 --> 01:36:56,044
A lot of them.

854
01:36:56,296 --> 01:37:00,132
Find the isolation valve
aft of the leak,
and crank it down.

855
01:37:00,633 --> 01:37:02,217
Got it?
Yeah.

856
01:37:03,636 --> 01:37:06,179
I rigged this hose
so you can breathe through it.

857
01:37:06,264 --> 01:37:09,641
Now listen to me.
As soon as you finish,
you get out of there.

858
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:11,643
Okay?
Yeah.

859
01:37:33,082 --> 01:37:34,374
I can hear her.

860
01:37:36,669 --> 01:37:38,378
Making slow turns.

861
01:37:43,718 --> 01:37:45,552
She just stopped her screws.

862
01:37:48,932 --> 01:37:50,766
I think they see the debris.

863
01:37:54,145 --> 01:37:55,854
I think they're buying it.

864
01:37:56,147 --> 01:37:58,023
180 meters.

865
01:37:59,484 --> 01:38:02,527
Chief, can you slow
our ascent some?
We are not ready.

866
01:38:03,363 --> 01:38:04,571
Can't, sir.

867
01:38:05,823 --> 01:38:07,908
We got a one-way ticket
topside.

868
01:38:10,662 --> 01:38:14,206
If we surface without
a torpedo to fire, we're dead.

869
01:38:52,745 --> 01:38:54,162
There's two air leaks.

870
01:38:54,247 --> 01:38:55,998
I got one,
but the other one's
way in the back.

871
01:38:56,082 --> 01:38:58,083
I need some more
slack on the hose
to get to it.

872
01:38:58,167 --> 01:38:59,459
That's all there is.

873
01:38:59,544 --> 01:39:00,627
Shit.

874
01:39:22,316 --> 01:39:24,776
150 meters.

875
01:39:28,781 --> 01:39:30,198
I hear Morse code.

876
01:39:32,076 --> 01:39:34,786
What the hell is it?
Are they signaling us?

877
01:39:43,046 --> 01:39:44,755
What's it saying, Wentz?

878
01:39:45,256 --> 01:39:47,632
"I am U-571. Destroy me."

879
01:39:59,103 --> 01:40:01,480
Coming up on 90 meters.

880
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:20,999
Sir, she's started
her engines again.

881
01:40:25,546 --> 01:40:28,465
No go, Mr. Tyler.
He can't reach.

882
01:40:36,682 --> 01:40:37,849
Trigger. . .

883
01:40:37,934 --> 01:40:40,769
in one minute
we're gonna hit the surface.
Do you understand me?

884
01:40:40,853 --> 01:40:43,355
Now you've got to
go back in there and try.

885
01:40:43,606 --> 01:40:45,690
I wouldn't ask you
if our lives
didn't depend on it.

886
01:40:45,775 --> 01:40:49,361
Sorry, sir. I can't reach it.
No, no, Trigger.
Now listen to me.

887
01:40:51,489 --> 01:40:54,241
You can reach it,
and you will.

888
01:40:55,535 --> 01:40:58,120
Now you are gonna close
that valve.
I can't!

889
01:40:58,204 --> 01:41:00,747
God damn it,
you're the only chance
we've got.

890
01:41:05,336 --> 01:41:07,963
Now you're gonna
go back down in that bilge. . .

891
01:41:08,214 --> 01:41:11,007
and you're gonna
do your job, sailor.

892
01:41:23,437 --> 01:41:25,730
Report to me the instant
that torpedo's ready to fire.

893
01:41:25,815 --> 01:41:27,065
Yes, sir.

894
01:41:30,027 --> 01:41:31,236
30 meters.

895
01:41:32,196 --> 01:41:34,364
- Talk to me, Wentz.
- Destroyer is underway.

896
01:41:34,448 --> 01:41:37,576
Steady bearing.
They're closing our position.

897
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:41,079
Shit! Come on, Trigger!

898
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:43,331
20 meters.

899
01:41:43,416 --> 01:41:45,333
Hold on. We're gonna surface.

900
01:41:45,418 --> 01:41:46,793
Raising scope.

901
01:41:56,888 --> 01:41:58,096
Got her.

902
01:41:58,848 --> 01:42:00,640
She's heading right for us.

903
01:42:01,434 --> 01:42:04,477
elm, come right 10 degrees.
Helm, come right
10 degrees. Aye, sir!

904
01:42:04,604 --> 01:42:06,938
Watch your bow planes.
Aye, sir.
Watching my bow planes.

905
01:42:07,023 --> 01:42:09,399
Tank, start the diesel.
All ahead full.

906
01:42:18,284 --> 01:42:20,202
Port diesel ahead full.

907
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:43,892
Shit, they've got us
bracketed.

908
01:42:45,645 --> 01:42:46,937
Incoming.

909
01:42:54,445 --> 01:42:56,279
We're hit!
We're hit!

910
01:42:56,906 --> 01:42:59,658
Wentz, get in here.
Eddie,
secure that hatch.

911
01:43:18,678 --> 01:43:20,470
Tube still not ready.

912
01:43:27,144 --> 01:43:30,522
Request permission
to abandon ship.
Not yet, Chief.

913
01:43:52,628 --> 01:43:55,588
Control, answer.
Torpedo now ready
in all respects.

914
01:43:55,673 --> 01:43:57,799
Hold us right there, Rabbit.
Hold us steady right here.

915
01:43:57,883 --> 01:44:00,051
Steady on bearing
80 degrees, sir.

916
01:44:01,721 --> 01:44:02,846
Fire.

917
01:44:04,307 --> 01:44:06,308
Tank, fire right now
or we die!

918
01:44:06,851 --> 01:44:07,892
Come on.

919
01:44:12,398 --> 01:44:13,773
Okay, come on.

920
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,128
That blew them right in half.

921
01:45:28,641 --> 01:45:31,643
Hell, Mr. Tyler,
if you ever need a chief. . .

922
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,521
I'd go to sea
with you anytime.

923
01:45:36,357 --> 01:45:37,732
Thank you, Chief.

924
01:45:48,035 --> 01:45:49,452
Tank, you okay?

925
01:45:52,957 --> 01:45:54,290
Trigger drowned.

926
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:07,053
That kid didn't give up,
did he?

927
01:46:11,308 --> 01:46:13,101
Neither did you, Mr. Tyler.

928
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:27,532
We can't keep her afloat
much longer, sir.

929
01:46:36,876 --> 01:46:38,376
Let's abandon ship.

930
01:48:14,181 --> 01:48:15,723
Mr. Tyler. Sir.
