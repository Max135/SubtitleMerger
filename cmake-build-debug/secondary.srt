of England by America

Unable to decipher 
U-Boot radio codes

00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,649

the German offensive

Hunted torpedoes

17
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,036
Impact

18
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:37,170
Bravo !

00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,925
Well aimed

20
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:47,597
There you are, Gentlemen!

21
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,309
We had them!

22
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:00,943
Fast propellers!

34
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:57,166
Where we are ?

35
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,171
Stabilized at 220

36
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,050

Grenades !

41
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:41,502
Hang on!

42
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:44,672
The roast beef shits on us

43
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:17,598
Seal up!

44
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:38,702
We're 120m away, Commander

45
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:42,456
Hunt the ballasts! Area !

46
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,119
Look out for the kiosk!

47

Machine room, answer!

48
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,666
Hans! A damage report!

49
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,628
They're all dead, Commander

50
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:33,465
The Chief Engineer, the others

51
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:37,845
the big one, all of them. 
They are all dead

52
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:40,264
Port exhaust destroyed

00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:56,071
- The batteries ? 
- damaged

57
00:07:56,655 --> 00:08:00,367
300 amps at the bow, 200 at the stern

58
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:02,036
Damn!

59
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:07,416
Barely enough to dive 
and maneuver

60
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:12,921
Thanks, Hans

61
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:15,632
Say save electricity

Here it is !

70
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,935
Andy! Where have you been ? 
Come and let me introduce you to Joanie

71
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:53,689
Joanie, Andy Tyler, my best friend. 
We did Annapolis together

72
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:54,815
Nice to meet you

73
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:59,194
Here, a Larson cigar. 
For our future Pasha

74
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,408
Lieutenant! Will you come to 
drink with the guys?

75
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,076
Heard, Griggs

76
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:16,253
- Can I introduce you to my Mother? 
- Of course

77
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:18,714
He's the one I told you about

78
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:30,934
Louise. Mrs. Dahlgren. commanding officer

79
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:34,730
You are alone ? 
It doesn't look like you

80
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,733
It is because I was warned very 
late, Madam

81
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,735
Can I say a word to you, 
Commander?

82
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,028
Certainly

83
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:44,031
You apologize? I will be back

84
00:10:58,003 --> 00:10:59,421
I don't have my Command

85
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:01,256
I know

86
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:05,218
Sorry, Commander, 
but I can only see one explanation

87
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,596
That you refused your deposit

88
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:09,681
That's right

89
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:12,893
You are not ready

90
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,811
What do you mean, not ready?

91
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:18,857
I did my best on the S-33

92
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:23,320
I am the highest rated 
of all the Officers in Second

93
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:28,575
You are not ready 
to assume a Command

94
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:35,415
I've made my decision. 
And that's all

95
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,507
Are you okay, Lieutenant?

96
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:45,592
You are having fun ?

97
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:47,719
And how, Chief

98
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:50,222
And you ?

99
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:54,643
I can't wait to get on board. 
I miss the sea air

100
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:00,565
He torpedoed me, Chief

101
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,069
Nine months aboard the S-33

102
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,322
to do the best job possible

103
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,367
Do everything twice rather than once

104
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:14,329
to be sure 
not to miss anything

105
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,208
Your turn will come, Lieutenant. 
There are other Commandments

106
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:24,881
Did you know ?

107
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:28,802
You didn't tell me anything

108
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:34,891
It wasn't for me to do it

109
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,853
The Mess is closed. Withdraw

110
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,029
Explain yourself, sergeant

111
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:51,241
- Are you the responsible officer? 
- The Second of S-33

112
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,952
These men have a 
48-hour leave

113
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:55,871
Not anymore, Lieutenant

114
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:28,278
Team 3

115
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:30,530
To the report before the relief

116
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:32,824
Team 3, 
to the report of the Principal Master

117
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,502
What are they doing to my boat?

118
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:46,796
Looks like a Nazi Submarine

119
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:50,925
Another coup from the Navy

120
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:53,553
Detachment C, to security

121
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:57,974
I didn't have 5 minutes 
to consummate my marriage

122
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,519
- What is happening ? 
- I don't know

123
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,979
Cover yourself

124
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,650
- Gather the Crew 
- Yes, Commander

125
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:12,197
Gathering! In a row ! 
Execution!

126
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:15,742
We hurry!

127
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,919
Crew present, Captain

128
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:26,920
Perfect

129
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:28,046
Repos !

130
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:34,344
Sorry for your permission. 
Change of program

131
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:38,348
We have two hours 
to board and set sail

132
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:43,019
Mr. Larson, let your torpedo boats 
load the tubes

133
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:47,065
Mr. Emmett, 
heat up the diesels

134
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,985
Mr. Tyler, we have food 
and equipment to embark

135
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:54,781
Gentlemen, it's up to us!

136
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:57,408
That's it

137
00:14:57,909 --> 00:14:59,744
Take care of yourself !

138
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,626
Break ranks!

139
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,419
Execution!

140
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:12,924
You have 6 seconds 
to get dressed!

141
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:16,803
- Isn't that a workout? 
- I'll take my mother home tomorrow

142
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,681
But we had permission. 
What's going on?

143
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:21,141
I dunno

144
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:23,017
I will inquire

145
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:24,978
At work

146
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:33,820
We obviously do 
n't sail for the Carabs, Commander

147
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:36,614
We are going on a special operation

148
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:40,076
You will receive your instructions 
after fitting

149
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:41,703
At your service !

150
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:42,954
Listen, Andy

151
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:48,084
I rely on you 100% 
despite our dispute

152
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,836
It's heard ?

153
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:53,339
Well

154
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:58,511
Discreetly drive 
the Wentz radio to the hardware

155
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,104
Are you alright, son?

156
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,023
Alright, Admiral

157
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:14,527
- What brings you ? 
- Him. It's Lieutenant Hirsch

158
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:16,654
He embarks with you

159
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:21,367
For this operation, you no 
longer depend on us, but on him

160
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:24,454
He's the boss. 
He decides everything

161
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,415
This is the Minister's point of view

162
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,959
Good

163
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,005
It's him ?

164
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:40,136
I was told

165
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:43,765
that your family 
is from Koblenz

166
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:47,977
A real family 
of Rhenish peasants

167
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:53,107
Do you understand me, Herr Wentz?

168
00:16:55,943 --> 00:17:00,198
Do you speak German fluently? 
Can you read and write it?

169
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,076
Or are you an illiterate redneck

170
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:05,328
in the German name?

171
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,667
I am a redneck

172
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,921
but I can read and write 
and I speak well

173
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:17,256
I studied German

174
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:22,970
at university before committing 
to the fight against fascism

175
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,771
Thanks, Wentz

176
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:33,022
It will be fine

177
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:35,983
You can dispose

178
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,820
Prepare the departure, 
Lieutenant

179
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:50,289
Please

180
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:52,708
don't say i'm 
half german

181
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,169
On me haïrait

182
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:58,631
Count on me

183
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:25,950
You are fine ?

184
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,707
Absolutely fine, Eddie

185
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,421
Thank you for the permission

186
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:43,801
My girlfriend too

187
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:47,638
You are a good guy

188
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:50,683
You have a good heart

189
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,227
Let time take its course

190
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:00,026
Yes i am aware

191
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:06,490
This is the advantage 
of going unnoticed

192
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,077
We hear everything, us

193
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,249
Watch out for my eggs!

194
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:20,254
Take the boxes with both hands

195
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:29,055
Had to tell me, 
I learn it from the Chef

196
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,141
I have nothing to say. He fucked me up

197
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,352
Are you going to be transferred?

198
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,605
Excuse me. Where is the Second?

199
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,025
It's me. 
We will unload your truck

200
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:42,735
Right now

201
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:45,529
Here is the list. Embark that

202
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,572
Who are you ?

203
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:50,910
Major Coonan, Intelligence. 
I embark with you

204
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:55,247
This is my luggage. 
Don't you like it? See Hirsch

205
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:15,726
Drop the point!

206
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,479
Drop the rear!

207
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:24,902
Rudder at zero, forward slow

208
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,251
Kiosk closed

209
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,963
Engine room, 
switch to electric propulsion

210
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,758
Closed diesels

211
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:31,760
Green indicator

212
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:34,763
180 m deep, compliant

213
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:37,808
Electric propulsion

214
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:39,602
Before two thirds

215
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:46,317
Dive 150 feet. 
Dive bar at 10

216
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:53,490
Give the dive alert. 
Open the ballasts

217
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,242
Order transmitted, Commander

218
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:58,913
Diving!

219
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,292
The ballasts are open

220
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,211
Dive bars 15

221
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,052
Submerged bridge

222
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,667
It's the first time ?

223
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:47,044
Absolutely

224
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,632
60 feet

225
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:56,637
Retract the periscope

226
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,018
Small leak on shaft 
and fresh water pump

227
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:06,313
18 inches of water in the bilge

228
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:10,109
How far does it go?

229
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:12,736
Basically, if we let it happen

230
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:18,200
Normally, we stop at 150 feet. 
Otherwise the pumps provide more

231
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:22,621
This tub is older 
than the Crew

232
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,127
100 feet

233
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:39,972
Seal and place lusin

234
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,141
We will repair at the port

235
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,732
Relax. 
He's old, but he's holding up

236
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:54,862
Yesterday at 3 a.m.

237
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:58,824
an English Destroyer sank 
a U-Boot

238
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,911
but soon after, 
the allied stations

239
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,873
have spotted a radio signal

240
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,876
here near the dividing line

241
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,171
U-Boot must be disabled, 
not sunk

242
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:14,965
and drift east at 4 knots

243
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:18,135
The Resistance says 
a Supply Submarine

244
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:23,348
left Lorient yesterday 
with parts and Mechanics

245
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:24,641
We think

246
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:27,144
that he will join the U-Boot

247
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:30,814
On board the U-Boot, there is this

248
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:38,614
- A typewriter ? 
- An ENIGMA encryption machine

249
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:42,493
With her, the Germans 
communicate in secret

250
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:46,997
Unable to decipher their 
messages, we will lose the war

251
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,877
It's the trojan's blow

252
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:56,465
The S-33 will replace the 
German supply submarine

253
00:24:57,007 --> 00:24:59,843
At the head of a commando disguised 
as German sailors

254
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:03,764
I will take 
over the U-Boot and the ENIGMA

255
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:07,893
After transferring the survivors, 
we will scuttle the U-Boot

256
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:10,562
The Supply Submarine

257
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:13,941
will believe that the U-Boot ended 
up sinking

258
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:16,360
The enemy must not suspect 
a thing

259
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,778
It is vital

260
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:20,489
- Is it a race? 
- Indeed

261
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:24,201
- Who will the commando understand? 
- You, as Second

262
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:25,577
Emmett, Larson

263
00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:27,579
Hirsch and 9 men

264
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:30,707
The Commander will remain aboard 
the S-33

265
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:36,046
Our men are Submarines, 
not Marines

266
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:40,342
Your men will be ready, 
I will train them

267
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:45,180
We will be up to the task

268
00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:27,973
Okay, we try

269
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:46,992
Do you call yourself a mechanic?

270
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,455
I was an apprentice with my uncle, 
I repaired motorcycles

271
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,415
I do what I can

272
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,292
Here we are!

273
00:26:57,711 --> 00:26:59,296
Commander, on the bridge!

274
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:01,047
I need a Mechanic

275
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:17,063
Guten Tag! 
We have a lot of injuries

276
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:18,815
Take us prisoner

277
00:27:19,065 --> 00:27:20,734
What do they want?

278
00:27:24,738 --> 00:27:26,990
That we collect them

279
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:30,744
Impossible. Open fire

280
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:32,537
What?

281
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:37,918
No castaways on board. 
Order of FÜHRER

282
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,963
And if we leave them

283
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,219
they risk 
giving our position

284
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:50,222
Execution!

285
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:30,178
More exciting than Dorothy Lamour

286
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:31,263
No kidding ?

287
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:35,934
And I interested her, 
but she had class

288
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:40,146
The kind we take 
to a select club

289
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,275
You never set foot there

290
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,235
And i don't miss it

291
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:47,904
In any case

292
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:51,616
I saw that I was getting 
nowhere with her

293
00:28:51,825 --> 00:28:53,702
and I pulled out my secret weapon

294
00:28:54,411 --> 00:28:57,289
I mentioned the S-26. It worked

295
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,082
Don't talk about it now

296
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,211
What is the story of the S-26?

297
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:05,213
Don't you know?

298
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:11,386
A test dive 
off Norfolk

299
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:13,930
A waterway

300
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:17,892
He sank at 400 feet

301
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:21,187
Can you imagine the pressure?

302
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:37,829
Mazzola !

303
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:40,999
I reserve the powdered eggs for you

304
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:50,216
Come in

305
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:58,099
This is our position

306
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:02,812
The sea is rough, 
we are 3 hours late

307
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:07,692
I told Emmett to force 
the speed to catch up

308
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:09,527
It's perfect

309
00:30:11,988 --> 00:30:14,073
You are an excellent Second

310
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:17,035
A really good Submariner

311
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:21,915
Men like you

312
00:30:22,832 --> 00:30:24,626
I would give my life for them

313
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:27,879
I know. 
I don't doubt your bravery

314
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:31,841
The question is their own life

315
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,346
You and Emmett are friends

316
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:38,932
You did Annapolis together

317
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:42,435
Would you be ready to sacrifice 
his life?

318
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:45,688
And the youngest sailors?

319
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:49,192
They see you 
as a big brother

320
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:51,945
Would you risk their lives?

321
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:57,075
You see, you hesitate

322
00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:00,787
The Commander can't hesitate

323
00:31:01,788 --> 00:31:03,206
He must act

324
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:06,709
Otherwise, he puts the whole crew 
in danger.

325
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,047
It's our job. 
It's not a science

326
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:15,802
Knowing how to make 
difficult decisions while being poorly informed

327
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:20,056
Giving orders 
that may result in death

328
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:24,602
And, in case of error, 
bear the consequences

329
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:28,398
If we're not ready 
to make these decisions

330
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:33,069
without hesitation, without thinking

331
00:31:34,737 --> 00:31:37,657
you cannot order 
a Sub

332
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:46,082
Tell Hirsch 
I want to talk to him

333
00:32:55,485 --> 00:32:57,445
Shall I tighten you up, Commander?

334
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:01,449
I would like to go with you

335
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:03,951
It's my feeling too

336
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:07,371
Gentlemen, a toast

337
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:10,166
To the Officers and Crew 
of the S-33

338
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,002
And to our hosts, 
MM Hirsch and Coonan

339
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:17,381
To our success, Gentlemen

340
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,221
- Commanding officer ? 
- What is it ?

341
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:27,058
The Chief says we have 
radar contact at 70

342
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:48,830
Forward starboard signal!

343
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:53,751
I see him

344
00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:58,130
Spread the word

345
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:01,425
Submarine in sight. 
At battle stations

346
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:07,306
Alright, one last time

347
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,767
Tyler takes over the booth

348
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,186
I, machine gunners

349
00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:14,689
Nobody shoots before me

350
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,357
Including ?

351
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,069
Perfect. Arm

352
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:31,581
Everything will be alright

353
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:40,506
The supply U-Boot spins 14 knots

354
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:42,967
So it's 12 hours from here

355
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:47,888
The commando awaits your signal

356
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:52,101
I try to show 
as little as possible to the U-Boot

357
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:56,897
Prepare to land the commando

358
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:06,073
If it fails I'll sink these Nazis

359
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:07,616
It's understood

360
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:09,452
Perfect

361
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:39,357
Ready!

362
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:42,193
Listen to me carefully

363
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:45,321
Capture their toy 
and come back immediately

364
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,325
The sailors will be perfect

365
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:52,161
I know, Commander

366
00:35:55,998 --> 00:35:56,916
Good luck

367
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:00,586
Good winds, Commander

368
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:31,617
Our comrades bring eggs

369
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:36,205
bananas 
and even our mail!

370
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:37,766
Calm down, Hirsch

371
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:39,518
We are almost there

372
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:42,479
We will pay for them

373
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,488
They are 12.3 
on the kiosk

374
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:54,366
4 at the bow, 5 at the stern

375
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:57,828
We must moor the rafts

376
00:37:58,454 --> 00:37:59,747
before acting

377
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:06,503
Whore ! 
They have machine guns

378
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,964
Calm down

379
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:11,300
Wait for the signal

380
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,405
You're in luck !

381
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:35,908
We have work for you

382
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:45,084
- Greet them! 
- Shut up

383
00:38:55,844 --> 00:38:57,805
Damn say something

384
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:02,351
Who are the mechanics?

385
00:39:13,112 --> 00:39:15,531
We are all mechanical aces

386
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:19,993
It will be fixed at dawn

387
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:25,165
Who wants this filth?

388
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:29,211
A bunch of dirty letters 
and porn pictures?

389
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:33,006
It stinks of French perfume!

390
00:39:33,715 --> 00:39:36,301
A real bag of shit!

391
00:39:36,552 --> 00:39:38,303
I'm crazy about it!

392
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,744
welcome aboard

393
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:05,122
Are you from Wiesbaden?

394
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:24,266
Go up!

395
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,768
Push them back

396
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:28,103
Diving!

397
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,647
Booth ! Quickly !

398
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:35,736
Clean the kiosk!

399
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,075
Another !

400
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:44,995
Griggs is hit!

401
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,338
Trigger, behind!

402
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:00,719
You have to enter!

403
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:03,221
Get off!

404
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:11,146
Quick, open! Fire!

405
00:41:14,066 --> 00:41:15,484
Tyler, forward!

406
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:16,777
Come in!

407
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:20,113
Cover your men!

408
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:27,871
Prevent them from closing!

409
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:36,588
Open the ballasts

410
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:39,966
Let's drown this vermin! 
Get your ass off!

411
00:41:43,845 --> 00:41:45,972
Faster ! Diving!

412
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:52,813
Close !

413
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,899
Get off!

414
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:10,956
Do not move !

415
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,499
Back off!

416
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:15,001
Drop it off !

417
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:17,587
Fire!

418
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,346
Take them!

419
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:29,641
- It's okay ? 
- Yes, Lieutenant

420
00:42:34,896 --> 00:42:37,607
Stern team! Leading team!

421
00:42:43,572 --> 00:42:45,365
I have no more charger

422
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,537
Take them out

423
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:51,705
On your knees!

424
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:55,500
Who is the Commander?

425
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,880
Are you the awful one?

426
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,593
At the first gesture, shoot! Including ?

427
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,281
On l'a

428
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:32,263
Don't shoot!

429
00:44:32,597 --> 00:44:33,515
On your knees!

430
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:39,979
See if they've trapped the hold

431
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:41,064
Your weapon!

432
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:48,029
Do not move !

433
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:53,284
On a les codes !

434
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:55,829
Ink is flowing, dry them

435
00:44:57,205 --> 00:44:58,665
It is soluble

436
00:44:59,374 --> 00:45:01,084
With blankets

437
00:45:03,962 --> 00:45:05,672
There are only pipes

438
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:07,757
We hold the bow

439
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:33,825
Bunch of wimps

440
00:45:36,911 --> 00:45:38,246
Is it gauzy?

441
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,665
You're number 10

442
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,418
Is the evening good?

443
00:45:45,253 --> 00:45:47,547
The FÜHRER will not be happy

444
00:45:47,755 --> 00:45:50,008
The 11th brings good luck

445
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:54,220
You've never seen black, eh?

446
00:45:54,762 --> 00:45:56,181
You will get used to

447
00:45:56,848 --> 00:45:58,892
Go! This way !

448
00:46:33,635 --> 00:46:36,012
Only an hour before dawn!

449
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,178
The wick burns

450
00:47:18,012 --> 00:47:20,139
Load the raft!

451
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:21,808
Let's hurry!

452
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:27,480
The prisoners 
are on board the S-33

453
00:47:37,865 --> 00:47:40,410
Load everything on the raft

454
00:47:40,785 --> 00:47:42,620
Let's go!

455
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:27,331
Come in everyone! We are being attacked!

456
00:48:27,832 --> 00:48:29,167
Chief ! In diving!

457
00:48:30,585 --> 00:48:31,794
- Lives ! 
- THE ENIGMA!

458
00:48:35,256 --> 00:48:37,216
Get off everyone!

459
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,470
Catch!

460
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:55,359
Help !

461
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:06,579
You have to get out

462
00:49:08,122 --> 00:49:09,916
- There are more 
- Let's go

463
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,885
Andy !

464
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:24,472
Go for it !

465
00:49:26,724 --> 00:49:27,558
In diving!

466
00:49:32,313 --> 00:49:33,606
In diving!

467
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:43,384
- Can you find them? 
- Everything is in German

468
00:50:43,968 --> 00:50:45,386
Rabbit, torpedo launcher

469
00:50:45,636 --> 00:50:47,263
Where's the intercom?

470
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:49,849
Trigger, at the helm

471
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:53,853
- And that ? 
- I dunno. There is nothing written

472
00:50:54,395 --> 00:50:56,397
Rear ballasts

473
00:50:57,148 --> 00:50:59,692
Diesel air intake

474
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:02,903
- Shut them up 
- Give me speed

475
00:51:03,487 --> 00:51:07,324
There must be 
juice in the batteries

476
00:51:07,575 --> 00:51:08,367
I understand nothing !

477
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:12,204
Count the torpedoes 
and see how to launch them

478
00:51:13,664 --> 00:51:16,250
- I don't understand anything 
- Go help him

479
00:51:18,669 --> 00:51:19,670
The indicators

480
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:22,214
Let everything be closed

481
00:51:24,008 --> 00:51:25,384
What is it, klar?

482
00:51:25,593 --> 00:51:28,804
It means "clear". 
Everything is closed

483
00:51:29,013 --> 00:51:30,014
White, is it green?

484
00:51:30,264 --> 00:51:32,725
Everything is closed. 
Make us dive

485
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:34,935
Open the ballasts!

486
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:38,689
Opening of ballasts

487
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:51,994
Front compensator. Back. 
And that, the auxiliaries

488
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:54,830
Main motor. 
Auxiliary

489
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:12,515
Everything is in meters

490
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:13,849
Depth 15 m

491
00:52:14,558 --> 00:52:15,893
Closing of ballasts?

492
00:52:16,143 --> 00:52:17,061
Close

493
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:19,271
Wentz, go to the hydrophone

494
00:52:20,564 --> 00:52:22,024
Stabilize at 20 m

495
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,068
Take control

496
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:26,070
I have them

497
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:28,155
Twenty meters

498
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:30,658
Front dive bar at zero

499
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:34,954
Shit !

500
00:52:35,162 --> 00:52:37,623
The batteries are dead, 
Commander

501
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:38,874
They empty

502
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:40,751
I hear the S-33 breaking

503
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:42,628
Wait

504
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:46,173
I have a diving U-Boot at 10

505
00:52:46,507 --> 00:52:48,509
Very close. Less than half a mile

506
00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:51,929
- The mothership! Our course? 
- 280

507
00:52:52,179 --> 00:52:54,974
All starboard. Stabilize on 10

508
00:52:58,769 --> 00:52:59,895
Full aft port

509
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,982
- Rabbit, answer 
- Full aft port

510
00:53:08,696 --> 00:53:10,531
Watch your depth

511
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:11,824
Rabbit !

512
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:16,620
We have 4. The tubes must be prepared

513
00:53:17,538 --> 00:53:19,623
- But I can't find the valve 
- Go help him

514
00:53:19,957 --> 00:53:22,293
The enemy is approaching! A torpedo!

515
00:53:24,128 --> 00:53:25,587
Stay where you are

516
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:27,798
Hirsch, go to the torpedoes

517
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:35,264
- Announce the course every 10 
- 320

518
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:36,682
Vire, small

519
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:42,146
Holy shit, this is crazy!

520
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:43,814
I can not fill!

521
00:53:45,566 --> 00:53:47,651
- What are you looking for ? 
- Filling !

522
00:53:49,153 --> 00:53:50,320
Gyro ?

523
00:53:50,571 --> 00:53:52,364
Drain?

524
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:55,117
Zero degrees!

525
00:53:55,659 --> 00:53:57,327
You're going to turn, you bastard!

526
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:01,498
We might have to open 
the compensator before

527
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,880
Propulsion ?

528
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:10,966
- Pressure differential? 
- That's it ! Turn!

529
00:54:11,175 --> 00:54:11,842
What meaning ?

530
00:54:12,092 --> 00:54:14,094
Unlike needles 
of a watch

531
00:54:22,352 --> 00:54:24,271
The torpedo missed us

532
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:29,151
2 new torpedoes!

533
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,862
Better course towards U-Boot

534
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:33,781
10 degrees

535
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:35,657
Prepare to shoot

536
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:39,203
Tubes 1 and 2. 
Gyroscope at zero. Fire!

537
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:40,412
Fire!

538
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:45,709
What's going on ?

539
00:54:46,043 --> 00:54:47,002
What is that ?

540
00:54:47,377 --> 00:54:50,380
They are stuck! 
There is a security

541
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:53,258
Hunt them before they fart!

542
00:54:53,717 --> 00:54:58,138
- Look for something like "propulsion" 
- It was there! And there!

543
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:05,354
1 and 2 hunted. I prepare 3 and 4

544
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,481
3 and 4, fire!

545
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:17,366
The 4 eels are spinning

546
00:55:47,187 --> 00:55:49,606
They missed us

547
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:03,537
Holy shit!

548
00:56:09,209 --> 00:56:10,752
U-Boot jumped

549
00:56:12,379 --> 00:56:14,089
I hear the partitions crack

550
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:20,554
The S-33!

551
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:30,147
Let's surface for the survivors

552
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,234
Orient the dive bars. 
Drive out ballasts

553
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:20,614
Shit

554
00:58:14,584 --> 00:58:15,752
You speak English ?

555
00:58:21,174 --> 00:58:22,384
Your rank?

556
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:25,804
What are you doing ?

557
00:58:26,429 --> 00:58:27,472
Specialty?

558
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:39,901
Electrician? Good

559
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,863
You will help us with the batteries

560
00:58:45,699 --> 00:58:47,075
I see the Pasha!

561
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:03,425
The batteries are dead

562
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:06,386
We emptied them while maneuvering

563
00:59:07,137 --> 00:59:08,221
The diesels?

564
00:59:08,471 --> 00:59:11,641
The starboard engine 
can only be repaired in dry dock

565
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:13,810
The port engine is better

566
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,564
The Boches knew nothing about it

567
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:19,858
I believe I can fix

568
00:59:22,235 --> 00:59:23,987
Do for the best

569
00:59:26,656 --> 00:59:28,366
Okay listen to me

570
00:59:29,242 --> 00:59:31,036
We decided on a route

571
00:59:32,162 --> 00:59:33,663
Focus on England

572
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:37,375
It is the closest 
outside of France

573
00:59:40,253 --> 00:59:43,757
- How many torpedoes do we have? 
- One in the rear tube

574
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:46,134
But the compressed air leaks

575
00:59:47,344 --> 00:59:48,470
What, Trigger?

576
00:59:48,762 --> 00:59:50,388
Why not the radio?

577
00:59:51,181 --> 00:59:53,350
We send an SOS and we wait

578
00:59:53,933 --> 00:59:55,185
It's impossible

579
00:59:55,602 --> 01:00:00,357
The Germans will locate us 
where they lost 2 U-Boats

580
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,486
If they suspect that we have ENIGMA, 
they will change numbers

581
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:07,739
It would be the failure of our mission

582
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,079
Heading for England 
means heading west

583
01:00:15,372 --> 01:00:16,247
He is right

584
01:00:17,707 --> 01:00:20,210
- The Boches are at home 
- Listen to me

585
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,129
- It's crawling with U-Boot! 
- And we are disarmed

586
01:00:23,963 --> 01:00:26,257
Do you think I have the answer 
to everything?

587
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,135
That I know how to get out of it? 
But no

588
01:00:29,385 --> 01:00:30,637
I do not know

589
01:00:31,805 --> 01:00:34,474
- I'm for the radio 
- We didn't ring you

590
01:00:34,724 --> 01:00:37,477
- Take the risk 
- I said shut up

591
01:00:37,727 --> 01:00:39,896
- The Commander ... 
- He's dead!

592
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,728
That's crazy

593
01:02:03,229 --> 01:02:04,397
All this is crazy

594
01:02:05,315 --> 01:02:07,191
Risking your life 
for a typewriter

595
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:08,985
This is not a

596
01:02:10,153 --> 01:02:11,529
Yes, she has keys

597
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:15,700
- It's not 
- Still, it's crazy

598
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:18,870
It's the Navy that decides

599
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:24,709
If the Navy says it matters more 
than us, we'll die

600
01:02:26,252 --> 01:02:29,172
It's not crazy, it's our job

601
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:34,677
It would be up to you 
to order us, Chef

602
01:02:35,094 --> 01:02:38,473
Seems Dahlgren was going to 
fire Tyler from the Navy

603
01:02:40,516 --> 01:02:43,061
Stop your bullshit, sailor!

604
01:02:43,269 --> 01:02:47,607
Lieutenant Tyler is your Officer, 
you respect him

605
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:50,526
It's understood ?

606
01:03:38,991 --> 01:03:40,535
Look at these bastards

607
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:44,622
My father was a fisherman

608
01:03:46,332 --> 01:03:48,251
Boss of a small trawler

609
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:52,463
He was doing the whole Gulf, 
with a two-stroke diesel

610
01:03:53,756 --> 01:03:55,633
rotten to the gunwale

611
01:03:56,175 --> 01:04:00,179
No matter how much I washed the deck, 
it still stank of fish

612
01:04:01,931 --> 01:04:04,851
I swore I would never 
order one like this

613
01:04:08,771 --> 01:04:12,650
I saw myself 
on the bridge of a battleship

614
01:04:14,777 --> 01:04:16,362
A true Commander

615
01:04:17,947 --> 01:04:19,740
Can I speak frankly?

616
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,201
Of course

617
01:04:23,703 --> 01:04:24,871
In the Navy

618
01:04:26,205 --> 01:04:29,500
the Commander 
is a terrible power

619
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:32,253
a feared and respected man

620
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:35,173
omniscient and almighty

621
01:04:35,715 --> 01:04:38,676
Don't ever tell them 
"I don't know" again

622
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:43,139
These words kill a Crew 
worse than a grenade

623
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,353
You are the Pasha. The Pasha 
always knows what to do

624
01:04:54,984 --> 01:04:56,569
Plane to port before!

625
01:05:08,164 --> 01:05:11,125
Sorry, he 
suddenly burst out of the clouds

626
01:05:11,584 --> 01:05:13,961
Rabbit, Trigger, the machine gun!

627
01:05:15,922 --> 01:05:19,425
German. Looks like 
a reconnaissance device

628
01:05:20,593 --> 01:05:22,637
What is he doing so far away?

629
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:29,560
He's coming!

630
01:05:29,769 --> 01:05:33,731
Do not move. 
For him, we are on the same team

631
01:05:33,939 --> 01:05:34,899
Let him know

632
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:40,696
You have to shoot first to get it

633
01:05:40,946 --> 01:05:43,616
If we miss it, it will signal us

634
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:45,576
It will be much worse

635
01:05:46,035 --> 01:05:47,662
You're going to get us killed!

636
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,048
He returns !

637
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:07,807
He attacks. Do something

638
01:06:08,057 --> 01:06:10,351
- Shut up 
- Do something

639
01:06:10,726 --> 01:06:13,521
He's going to strafe us!

640
01:06:13,979 --> 01:06:15,940
- Sailor Parker! 
- What are you waiting for?

641
01:06:16,649 --> 01:06:20,111
- Drawn ! 
- I order you not to shoot!

642
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,488
- Let go of the trigger! 
- Drawn !

643
01:06:24,156 --> 01:06:26,700
- We're going to die! 
- Let go of the trigger!

644
01:06:36,919 --> 01:06:38,129
Where do you think you are?

645
01:06:38,671 --> 01:06:41,048
The Navy is not a democracy!

646
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:45,594
I see a mast on the horizon!

647
01:06:50,516 --> 01:06:52,893
Shit. A Nazi Destroyer

648
01:06:53,853 --> 01:06:56,605
Zinc was in gratitude 
for him

649
01:06:58,441 --> 01:06:59,442
Evacuate the bridge

650
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:03,195
- Prepare to dive 
- At your command!

651
01:08:00,586 --> 01:08:03,839
The indicator is not green. 
It's the machines

652
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,258
Ballasts respond more

653
01:08:06,508 --> 01:08:09,887
Tank, get ready to dive!

654
01:08:11,347 --> 01:08:12,890
Answer!

655
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:17,019
Go see what's going on

656
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:29,133
Drop it, Nazi bastard

657
01:09:42,438 --> 01:09:44,148
I apologize

658
01:09:44,773 --> 01:09:46,483
He knocked me out

659
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:48,402
Listen

660
01:09:50,362 --> 01:09:52,865
Find out why ballasts 
are more responsive!

661
01:09:56,702 --> 01:10:01,081
Chain me the hands 
and feet of that bastard

662
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,791
Immobilize it

663
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:04,585
Lieutenant !

664
01:10:04,793 --> 01:10:06,128
Do it, Eddie

665
01:10:24,813 --> 01:10:26,565
Tell Tank to fix it fast

666
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:30,068
- They send a star 
- It takes 5 minutes

667
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:31,320
We don't have them

668
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:35,699
The cannon can hit it 
below the waterline

669
01:10:35,908 --> 01:10:37,743
It would be useless

670
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:40,579
It would take a hundred

671
01:10:40,913 --> 01:10:43,582
We would need a torpedo

672
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:48,420
Trigger, with the machine gun. 
On my signal, destroy the speedboat

673
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:51,298
They will unmask us

674
01:10:57,012 --> 01:10:58,889
Trigger, get ready

675
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:02,935
Tank has a minute. 
Send Wentz and Rabbit with a PM

676
01:11:05,437 --> 01:11:07,731
What will they do when they know?

677
01:11:08,106 --> 01:11:10,025
After shooting us down

678
01:11:10,275 --> 01:11:13,779
they will warn HQ 
about ENIGMA

679
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:17,115
Let's destroy their radio

680
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,619
- Before they have time 
- How?

681
01:11:21,954 --> 01:11:23,288
At the cannon

682
01:11:23,538 --> 01:11:25,916
Difficult, but doable

683
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:29,211
Then we dive quickly

684
01:11:29,711 --> 01:11:33,799
We train them within range 
of our aerial cover

685
01:11:34,049 --> 01:11:35,634
We ask for a strike

686
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:38,220
That's it

687
01:11:39,638 --> 01:11:41,890
He cut the controls

688
01:11:42,474 --> 01:11:44,101
We must find the stop

689
01:11:54,987 --> 01:11:58,198
Do you see the large antenna 
behind the catwalk?

690
01:11:59,074 --> 01:12:00,409
It's the radio

691
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:02,202
To the cannon, to my command

692
01:12:02,411 --> 01:12:05,330
you put me a shell in this porthole

693
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:08,667
It's your turn

694
01:12:19,344 --> 01:12:20,846
Shall we send you a rope?

695
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:22,139
Right now

696
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:25,392
This is weird

697
01:12:28,603 --> 01:12:29,896
It's a trap

698
01:12:30,105 --> 01:12:31,148
Send them back

699
01:12:31,606 --> 01:12:32,691
Hands up

700
01:12:40,031 --> 01:12:41,199
Tackle!

701
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,577
Faster !

702
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:47,456
- Rabbit! 
- Ready to fire!

703
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:48,832
Fire!

704
01:13:05,807 --> 01:13:07,392
Evacuate the bridge!

705
01:13:14,816 --> 01:13:16,943
Quickly ! They shoot us

706
01:13:17,152 --> 01:13:17,861
Who ?

707
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:20,947
The U-Boot. 
They destroyed our radio

708
01:13:34,836 --> 01:13:35,795
Immersion !

709
01:13:50,101 --> 01:13:52,979
- Why don't we dive? 
- They are still repairing

710
01:13:53,772 --> 01:13:54,898
At the dive bars

711
01:13:55,106 --> 01:13:56,566
Forward all

712
01:14:00,111 --> 01:14:03,406
Hit to the goal. The radio is destroyed

713
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,168
- We go on them 
- Exactly

714
01:14:16,628 --> 01:14:19,297
To be safe from their guns

715
01:14:19,547 --> 01:14:22,092
It will remain to pass under the keel

716
01:14:36,314 --> 01:14:37,148
That's it

717
01:14:38,566 --> 01:14:42,237
- Order repaired 
- Done . We dive

718
01:14:53,248 --> 01:14:54,916
5 meters

719
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:06,177
10 meters

720
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:14,561
15 meters

721
01:15:43,381 --> 01:15:44,591
20 meters

722
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:22,337
Port side all

723
01:16:26,674 --> 01:16:28,384
Before 2 thirds

724
01:16:38,436 --> 01:16:39,604
He maneuvers

725
01:16:43,525 --> 01:16:45,109
Fast propellers

726
01:16:47,445 --> 01:16:48,321
Grenadage

727
01:16:58,456 --> 01:16:59,999
Close intervals

728
01:17:02,544 --> 01:17:04,045
Get ready to grenade

729
01:17:05,046 --> 01:17:06,881
Adjust depth 25

730
01:18:03,271 --> 01:18:05,565
Get away from the wall

731
01:18:08,026 --> 01:18:10,862
The shock wave 
can break your neck

732
01:18:19,287 --> 01:18:21,414
Have you ever been pomegranated?

733
01:18:21,622 --> 01:18:22,665
Once

734
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:26,836
Off Murmansk, 
during the other war

735
01:18:28,129 --> 01:18:32,258
One passed so close 
that the Pasha lost four teeth

736
01:18:43,644 --> 01:18:45,188
It was far

737
01:18:52,737 --> 01:18:55,448
Starboard electric motor stopped

738
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:58,284
The German will have sabotaged it

739
01:19:03,581 --> 01:19:07,460
We won't do it 
on a single propeller

740
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:06,871
Help the Chef

741
01:21:17,882 --> 01:21:19,342
Chief, here I am

742
01:21:22,303 --> 01:21:23,012
Tank

743
01:21:24,597 --> 01:21:25,639
still alive ?

744
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:30,061
Good

745
01:21:30,603 --> 01:21:33,689
Front port engine 2l3

746
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:07,681
Can you fix the tube?

747
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,643
I dunno

748
01:22:11,936 --> 01:22:14,105
This is not an answer

749
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:18,984
Can you fix the tube, 
yes or no?

750
01:22:21,779 --> 01:22:23,697
Yes, Commander

751
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:29,954
Let's go down to 160 meters

752
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,876
It's over 500 feet

753
01:22:38,879 --> 01:22:40,422
Got to get down, Chief

754
01:22:45,886 --> 01:22:47,388
160 meters

755
01:22:47,972 --> 01:22:49,932
Dive bars 20

756
01:22:52,977 --> 01:22:54,854
Commandant ?

757
01:22:55,896 --> 01:22:58,399
You plan to attack 
a Destroyer with

758
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:01,527
one torpedo, one engine?

759
01:23:02,194 --> 01:23:03,487
Exactly

760
01:23:03,988 --> 01:23:05,865
Is this very wise?

761
01:23:06,073 --> 01:23:06,991
Not very

762
01:23:07,408 --> 01:23:08,993
But come see

763
01:23:11,161 --> 01:23:15,874
No way to shoot 
a Destroyer spinning 30 knots

764
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,794
unless you sink

765
01:23:19,003 --> 01:23:23,424
At 160 m, we will chase debris 
through the front tubes

766
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:26,302
They will surface

767
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:31,473
The Destroyer will gain the area, 
stop the machines

768
01:23:31,682 --> 01:23:34,143
to ensure the sonar 
of our destruction

769
01:23:34,435 --> 01:23:35,561
Except that...

770
01:23:35,978 --> 01:23:37,229
we will be here

771
01:23:37,438 --> 01:23:40,190
ascent to 
periscope depth

772
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:43,027
Archimedes principle

773
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,447
Our buoyancy goes up 
as we move away from the Destroyer

774
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:49,700
We'll surface half a mile away 
with our backs to it

775
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:54,538
Perfect position for 
rear firing on a fixed target

776
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,083
We can't dream better

777
01:24:00,794 --> 01:24:02,046
Alright, Mr. Tyler

778
01:24:04,173 --> 01:24:06,175
130 meters

779
01:24:08,802 --> 01:24:12,806
Load Mazzola into tube 3 
with a life jacket

780
01:24:13,015 --> 01:24:14,558
so that he goes up

781
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,561
How do we throw garbage?

782
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:28,364
His corpse will save our lives

783
01:24:29,782 --> 01:24:31,533
I will say a prayer for him

784
01:24:32,076 --> 01:24:33,827
Hirsch, accompany Rabbit

785
01:24:34,078 --> 01:24:36,163
Eddie, will you hold the bars?

786
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:41,251
If you fail

787
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:44,171
the danger is not 
that we would die

788
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,715
but that we survive

789
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:51,929
These men know things that

790
01:24:52,137 --> 01:24:54,556
the enemy must not know 
at any cost

791
01:24:56,141 --> 01:24:57,434
Secrets

792
01:24:58,435 --> 01:25:00,395
like our radar capabilities

793
01:25:00,854 --> 01:25:03,232
and our knowledge 
of their number

794
01:25:04,983 --> 01:25:08,654
If they take us alive 
we'll be tortured

795
01:25:09,446 --> 01:25:11,907
Or you manage to sink 
the Destroyer

796
01:25:12,699 --> 01:25:15,869
or you will 
ensure that none of us survive

797
01:25:16,453 --> 01:25:17,830
to be captured

798
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,990
We commend his soul to God

799
01:25:54,032 --> 01:25:55,951
and his body to the abyss

800
01:25:57,703 --> 01:25:59,580
Port all!

801
01:26:05,419 --> 01:26:06,920
It zigzags

802
01:26:10,549 --> 01:26:11,341
Grenadage

803
01:26:13,927 --> 01:26:15,971
He gets closer

804
01:26:17,014 --> 01:26:18,473
More pomegranates

805
01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:34,531
Water must be removed 
from the bilges of the machines

806
01:26:54,593 --> 01:26:55,844
Hunt the tubes

807
01:28:15,257 --> 01:28:17,634
They settle them too short

808
01:29:38,173 --> 01:29:39,591
Block that!

809
01:29:56,024 --> 01:29:57,317
Depth?

810
01:29:58,902 --> 01:30:01,154
160 meters

811
01:30:02,822 --> 01:30:04,240
Zero bars

812
01:30:06,117 --> 01:30:07,327
Grenadage!

813
01:30:10,205 --> 01:30:11,915
Too close together

814
01:30:12,957 --> 01:30:14,584
I can't count them

815
01:30:27,514 --> 01:30:29,224
Take us down to 200 m

816
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:34,312
That we are under this filth

817
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:42,404
Take us down to 200 m

818
01:30:56,835 --> 01:30:59,129
I go down to 200 m

819
01:30:59,796 --> 01:31:02,048
Dive bars at 10

820
01:31:27,574 --> 01:31:29,534
170 meters

821
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:46,926
What is the condition of the rear tube?

822
01:31:48,261 --> 01:31:49,929
Two things wrong

823
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:53,433
The panels work 
but I'm working on the propulsion

824
01:31:54,142 --> 01:31:56,102
180 meters

825
01:31:59,731 --> 01:32:01,900
I have 180 meters, here

826
01:32:03,067 --> 01:32:05,195
Thanks, I know

827
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:08,281
Keep working

828
01:32:21,085 --> 01:32:23,171
190 meters

829
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:45,485
200 meters

830
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:47,987
Zero bars

831
01:33:53,428 --> 01:33:55,471
Holy Mary Mother of God

832
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,396
These Boches know how to build 
a boat

833
01:34:12,071 --> 01:34:13,489
On remonte !

834
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,452
In the other direction, Hirsch!

835
01:34:22,748 --> 01:34:24,625
Rabbit! Help me !

836
01:34:26,836 --> 01:34:28,254
Chief ! look

837
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:39,849
We're over the counter! 
You have to hunt ballasts

838
01:34:40,057 --> 01:34:41,184
Do it, Chef!

839
01:34:59,202 --> 01:35:01,078
It always goes down

840
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:05,833
The ballasts are empty! 
I try the compensators

841
01:35:26,062 --> 01:35:27,230
On remonte

842
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:47,166
We go up

843
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:51,879
But I have more control. 
I can't stop our ascent

844
01:35:53,297 --> 01:35:54,715
Where is the tube?

845
01:35:55,132 --> 01:35:57,760
The pipes are damaged

846
01:35:57,969 --> 01:36:00,388
I have no pressure to hunt

847
01:36:00,596 --> 01:36:03,641
The leak is at the bottom of the hold, 
under water

848
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:06,811
I can't reach it. 
I don't pass

849
01:36:07,269 --> 01:36:09,855
- Who can do it? 
- I dunno

850
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:12,900
Someone smaller

851
01:36:13,985 --> 01:36:15,569
Rabbit ou Trigger

852
01:36:15,945 --> 01:36:18,531
We go back 200 meters

853
01:36:19,031 --> 01:36:20,282
Must choose

854
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,754
Join Tank

855
01:36:35,548 --> 01:36:36,799
Quick, son

856
01:36:37,842 --> 01:36:39,260
You have a job

857
01:36:48,227 --> 01:36:51,063
You see ? There is no pressure

858
01:36:51,731 --> 01:36:53,566
One of the pipes is leaking

859
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:57,194
- How do I find him? 
- Thanks to the bubbles

860
01:36:57,987 --> 01:37:01,949
Close the valve 
behind the leak

861
01:37:02,158 --> 01:37:02,992
Pigeon?

862
01:37:05,244 --> 01:37:07,788
I made you a respirator

863
01:37:07,997 --> 01:37:11,333
Listen carefully. As soon as you finish, you come out

864
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,025
I hear it

865
01:37:38,235 --> 01:37:40,029
It turns slowly

866
01:37:45,451 --> 01:37:47,036
The propellers stop

867
01:37:50,581 --> 01:37:52,333
They must have seen the debris

868
01:37:55,836 --> 01:37:57,129
They believe in it

869
01:37:57,838 --> 01:37:59,632
180 meters

870
01:38:01,217 --> 01:38:04,345
Can you slow us down? 
We are not ready

871
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:06,472
No, Commander

872
01:38:07,556 --> 01:38:09,683
We only have one way

873
01:38:12,311 --> 01:38:15,898
If we surface without a torpedo, 
we're dead

874
01:38:54,478 --> 01:38:57,564
There are two leaks. 
The second is far away

875
01:38:57,773 --> 01:38:59,692
Give me some pipe

876
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,694
- There's no more 
- Shit

877
01:39:24,049 --> 01:39:26,301
150 meters

878
01:39:30,389 --> 01:39:31,598
You morse!

879
01:39:33,559 --> 01:39:35,060
What is that ?

880
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:36,770
Are they talking to us?

881
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:45,612
What does it say ?

882
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:48,991
"I am U-571. Destroy me"

883
01:40:00,753 --> 01:40:03,005
90 meters

884
01:40:21,273 --> 01:40:23,358
The propellers take off again

885
01:40:27,112 --> 01:40:30,073
Failed, Mr. Tyler. It is too far

886
01:40:39,374 --> 01:40:42,336
In a minute we surface, 
you know?

887
01:40:42,544 --> 01:40:45,088
You have to go back in there 
to try

888
01:40:45,297 --> 01:40:47,299
Our lives depend on it

889
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:49,301
I don't get that far

890
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:51,094
Listen to me

891
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:55,849
You can and you will

892
01:40:57,059 --> 01:40:59,770
You will close this valve

893
01:40:59,978 --> 01:41:01,730
This is our only chance

894
01:41:06,902 --> 01:41:09,446
You will return to the hold

895
01:41:09,905 --> 01:41:12,783
and do your job, sailor

896
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:27,631
Call me when the torpedo 
is ready

897
01:41:31,635 --> 01:41:32,636
30 meters

898
01:41:33,554 --> 01:41:35,681
- Wentz? 
- The Destroyer moves

899
01:41:35,973 --> 01:41:37,224
He stays the course

900
01:41:37,849 --> 01:41:40,352
Right on us

901
01:41:43,438 --> 01:41:44,439
20 meters

902
01:41:45,148 --> 01:41:46,650
We are going to surface

903
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:48,568
I take out the periscope

904
01:41:58,412 --> 01:41:59,329
I see him

905
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:01,957
He comes right at us

906
01:42:03,125 --> 01:42:04,835
To starboard 10

907
01:42:06,169 --> 01:42:07,462
Watch the bars

908
01:42:08,547 --> 01:42:10,048
Diesel in full swing

909
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:21,768
Diesel port before any

910
01:42:43,498 --> 01:42:45,208
They crisscross us!

911
01:42:47,044 --> 01:42:47,794
Shells!

912
01:42:56,053 --> 01:42:57,179
We are touched!

913
01:42:58,472 --> 01:43:01,224
- Wentz, come here! 
- Eddie, close the hatch

914
01:43:20,202 --> 01:43:21,286
Not ready yet

915
01:43:28,752 --> 01:43:30,504
Permission to abandon ship

916
01:43:30,712 --> 01:43:31,588
Not yet !

917
01:43:54,152 --> 01:43:56,988
Rear tube ready!

918
01:43:57,197 --> 01:43:59,407
Hold on tight

919
01:43:59,616 --> 01:44:00,992
Cap at 80!

920
01:44:03,286 --> 01:44:04,079
Fire!

921
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:07,249
Right away where we died

922
01:44:19,844 --> 01:44:21,388
A torpedo!

923
01:44:24,057 --> 01:44:25,559
All starboard!

924
01:45:16,776 --> 01:45:18,403
Cut in two

925
01:45:30,123 --> 01:45:33,335
If you need a Chef, Mr. Tyler

926
01:45:34,169 --> 01:45:36,171
i am your man

927
01:45:49,768 --> 01:45:51,061
It's okay ?

928
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:55,690
Trigger drowned

929
01:46:06,576 --> 01:46:08,411
He did not deflate

930
01:46:12,832 --> 01:46:14,751
Neither do you, Mr. Tyler

931
01:46:26,638 --> 01:46:28,598
On going hat

932
01:48:27,967 --> 01:48:29,385
Abandon ship

933
01:48:45,902 --> 01:48:49,822
This film is dedicated to 
Allied sailors and officers

934

who risked their lives 
to seize ENIGMA

935
01:48:53,576 --> 01:48:56,162
